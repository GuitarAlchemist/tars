Autonomous Execution System - Detailed Breakdown

6. Autonomous Execution System
   - Components:
     * Execution Planner: Create step-by-step execution plans for improvements
     * Safe Execution Environment: Isolated environment for applying changes
     * Change Validator: Verify changes meet quality and functionality requirements
     * Rollback Manager: Revert changes if validation fails
     * Auto-Coding System: Automatically implement TODOs and improve code
   - Integration Points:
     * Input: Improvement plans from Improvement Generation System
     * Output: Applied changes to codebase and execution reports
     * API: Execution control and monitoring interfaces
   - Success Criteria:
     * 99.9% safety record (no breaking changes in production)
     * 90%+ successful execution of improvement plans
     * Automatic rollback for 100% of failed changes
     * Successful auto-coding of TODOs with 80%+ pass rate
