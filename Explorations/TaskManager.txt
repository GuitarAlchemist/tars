Exploration: Task Manager Application

I'm thinking about creating a simple task manager application that can help users keep track of their tasks. Here are the key features I want to implement:

1. Task Management
   - Create new tasks with a title, description, due date, and priority
   - Mark tasks as complete
   - Delete tasks
   - Edit existing tasks

2. Task Categories
   - Group tasks into categories (e.g., Work, Personal, Shopping)
   - Filter tasks by category
   - Add, edit, and delete categories

3. Task Prioritization
   - Set priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
   - Sort tasks by priority
   - Visual indicators for high-priority tasks

4. Due Date Handling
   - Set due dates for tasks
   - Show overdue tasks
   - Send notifications for upcoming due dates
   - Sort tasks by due date

5. Data Persistence
   - Save tasks to a JSON file
   - Load tasks from a JSON file
   - Auto-save when changes are made

For the implementation, I'm thinking of using a simple class structure:

- Task class with properties for title, description, due date, priority, category, and completion status
- TaskManager class to handle the collection of tasks and operations on them
- Category class to represent task categories
- FileManager class to handle saving and loading data

The application should follow good object-oriented design principles and include proper error handling. For example, it should handle cases where the data file is corrupted or not found.

I want the code to be clean, well-documented, and easy to maintain. It should follow modern C# coding conventions and use appropriate design patterns.

Some additional thoughts:
- Maybe implement the Observer pattern to notify when tasks are added, modified, or deleted
- Use LINQ for filtering and sorting tasks
- Implement INotifyPropertyChanged for UI binding (if we later add a UI)
- Add unit tests to ensure the functionality works correctly

That's the basic idea. Let's see what we can come up with!
