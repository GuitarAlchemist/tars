Exploration: Microservice Architecture for E-Commerce Platform

I'm thinking about designing a microservice architecture for an e-commerce platform. The platform should be scalable, resilient, and maintainable. Here are the key components I'm considering:

1. Service Boundaries
   - Product Catalog Service: Manages product information, categories, and search
   - Order Service: Handles order processing, payment, and fulfillment
   - Customer Service: Manages customer accounts, profiles, and authentication
   - Inventory Service: Tracks product inventory and availability
   - Notification Service: Sends emails, SMS, and push notifications
   - Analytics Service: Collects and processes business metrics and user behavior

2. Communication Patterns
   - Synchronous communication via REST APIs for direct queries
   - Asynchronous communication via message queues for event-driven processes
   - Event sourcing for maintaining a complete history of state changes
   - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) for separating read and write operations

3. Data Management
   - Each service should have its own database (polyglot persistence)
   - Data consistency maintained through eventual consistency and compensating transactions
   - Data replication for read-heavy services
   - Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

4. Resilience Patterns
   - Circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
   - Retry pattern with exponential backoff for transient failures
   - Bulkhead pattern to isolate failures
   - Fallback mechanisms for degraded functionality

5. Deployment and Infrastructure
   - Containerization using Docker
   - Orchestration with Kubernetes
   - CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
   - Infrastructure as Code for reproducible environments

6. Monitoring and Observability
   - Distributed tracing for request flows across services
   - Centralized logging for troubleshooting
   - Health checks and metrics for system status
   - Alerting for critical issues

For the implementation, I want to use:
- .NET Core for the backend services
- Entity Framework Core for data access
- RabbitMQ for message queuing
- Redis for caching
- SQL Server and MongoDB for databases (depending on the service needs)
- Identity Server for authentication and authorization

I'd like to start by designing the core domain models and service interfaces for the Product Catalog Service. This service should provide:
- CRUD operations for products
- Category management
- Product search and filtering
- Product recommendations

The service should be RESTful and follow clean architecture principles with:
- Domain layer with entities and business logic
- Application layer with use cases and DTOs
- Infrastructure layer with data access and external services
- API layer for controllers and middleware

I'm particularly interested in implementing proper error handling, validation, and ensuring the service is testable and maintainable.

Let's explore how we might structure this service and what the key interfaces and models would look like.
