# TARS Docker Volumes

This directory contains Docker volumes used by TARS replicas.

## Volume Structure

- `config/`: Configuration files for TARS replicas
- `data/`: Data files generated by TARS replicas
- `logs/`: Log files from TARS replicas
- `codebase/`: Shared codebase for analysis and modification

## Usage

These volumes are mounted into the TARS replica containers to provide:

1. Persistent storage across container restarts
2. Shared access to code and data between replicas
3. Centralized logging and configuration

## Maintenance

Volumes are automatically created when replicas are started. They persist even when containers are stopped or removed.

To clean up volumes:

```bash
docker volume rm tars-config tars-data tars-logs tars-codebase
```
