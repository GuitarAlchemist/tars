# 🧹 TARS Repository Cleanup Summary

## 🎯 **Objective Achieved: Clean F#-Only Solution**

Successfully cleaned up the TARS repository by removing all C# projects and creating a pure F#-only solution that compiles successfully.

## 📊 **Before vs After**

### **Before Cleanup:**
- **Mixed solution** with 21+ projects (C# + F#)
- **Multiple C# projects** causing compilation conflicts
- **Large repository** with redundant code
- **Build errors** due to mixed dependencies
- **Confusing project structure** with overlapping functionality

### **After Cleanup:**
- **Pure F# solution** with 3 core projects
- **Clean compilation** with 0 errors (only minor warnings)
- **Streamlined structure** focused on F# migration
- **Preserved all F# migration work** and functionality
- **Legacy C# projects safely archived**
