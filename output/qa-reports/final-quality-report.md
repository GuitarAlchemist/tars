## 🔧 Technical Fixes Applied

### Package Management
```xml
<!-- Fixed version conflicts -->
<PackageReference Include="System.Text.Json" Version="9.0.0" />
<!-- Resolved FSharp.Core compatibility issues -->
```

### Code Quality
```fsharp
// Before: Reserved identifier usage
| Some process -> process.Kill()

// After: Proper identifier naming  
| Some processInstance -> processInstance.Kill()
```

### Type Safety
```fsharp
// Before: Unsafe type inference
let response = self.ProcessSelfQuestion(question).Result

// After: Explicit type annotations
let task : System.Threading.Tasks.Task<SelfDialogueResponse> = self.ProcessSelfQuestion(question)
let response = task.Result
```
