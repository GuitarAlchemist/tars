# Hugging Face Integration for TARS: A Guide to Browsing, Downloading, and Installing LLMs

TARS now integrates with Hugging Face, allowing you to effortlessly explore, download, and install Large Language Models (LLMs) from the Hugging Face Hub.

## Features

### Search and Discover

* Browse models based on keywords and tasks using `tarscli huggingface search`
* Find the highest-rated coding models with `tarscli huggingface best`

### Model Management

* View detailed information about any model using `tarscli huggingface details`
* Download a model from Hugging Face to your local machine with `tarscli huggingface download`
* Install a model to Ollama, including name and version management, using `tarscli huggingface install`

### Model Usage

* List all installed models with `tarscli huggingface list`
* Use the installed model with TARS commands that accept a model parameter (e.g., `tarscli self-analyze`)

## Prerequisites

* Git must be installed and available in your PATH
* Ollama must be installed and running
* Optional: A Hugging Face API key for accessing private models

## Configuration

To use the Hugging Face integration, add your Hugging Face API key to the `appsettings.json` file:

```json
"HuggingFace": {
  "ApiKey": "your-api-key-here",
  "DefaultTask": "text-generation"
}
```

## Examples

### Finding and Installing the Best Coding Model

1. Find the best coding models:
   ```
   tarscli huggingface best --limit 3
   ```

2. Get details about a specific model:
   ```
   tarscli huggingface details --model microsoft/phi-2
   ```

3. Install the model to Ollama:
   ```
   tarscli huggingface install --model microsoft/phi-2 --name phi2
   ```

4. Use the model with TARS:
   ```
   tarscli self-analyze --file test_code.cs --model phi2
   ```

## How It Works

The Hugging Face integration in TARS uses the Hugging Face API to search for models, download and install them, and manage installed models.

## Recommended Models for Coding

Here are some top-rated LLMs for coding:

* **microsoft/phi-2**: A compact yet powerful model for code generation
* **codellama/CodeLlama-7b-hf**: Specialized for code completion and generation
* **bigcode/starcoder**: Trained on a large corpus of code from GitHub

## Troubleshooting

* **API Key Issues**: Ensure your API key is correctly set in `appsettings.json`
* **Download Failures**: Check your internet connection and Git installation
* **Installation Failures**: Ensure Ollama is running and has sufficient disk space
* **Model Compatibility**: Not all models are compatible with Ollama; check the model architecture

## Future Enhancements

* Support for fine-tuning models
* Integration with TARS self-improvement system
* Automatic model benchmarking
* Model version management
* Support for other model formats and frameworks

Explanation of changes:

1. **Reorganized structure**: The original code was a long, unbroken list of features and commands. I reorganized it into clear sections, with headers and summaries to make it easier to navigate.
2. **Simplified feature descriptions**: Each feature now has a brief summary that explains its purpose and usage.
3. **Improved command examples**: The command examples are now more concise and easier to follow, with clear explanations of each option.
4. **Emphasized recommended models**: I highlighted the top-rated LLMs for coding, making it clearer which models are most useful.
5. **Simplified troubleshooting section**: The original troubleshooting section was long and complex. I condensed it into a shorter list of common issues and solutions.
6. **Added future enhancements section**: This new section outlines potential improvements to the Hugging Face integration, giving users an idea of what's coming next.

Overall, these changes make the documentation clearer, more concise, and easier to understand, allowing users to get started with the Hugging Face integration in TARS more quickly.
