# TARS Technical Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the TARS architecture, including its components, interactions, and design principles.

## System Overview

TARS is built using a modular, service-oriented architecture that enables flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability. The system primarily uses F# for core engine components and C# for CLI and application interfaces.

## Core Components

### TarsEngine

The `TarsEngine` is the heart of the system, providing core reasoning, analysis, and improvement capabilities. It is implemented in F# to leverage its strong type system, pattern matching, and functional programming features.

Key modules include:

- **TarsEngine.Interfaces**: Shared interfaces for system components
- **TarsEngine.SelfImprovement**: F# module for self-improvement capabilities
- **TarsEngineFSharp**: Core F# implementation of the engine

### TarsCli

The `TarsCli` is a command-line interface for interacting with TARS. It provides commands for various operations, including code analysis, improvement, and language model management.

Key components include:

- **Command Handlers**: Handlers for CLI commands
- **Services**: Services for various functionalities
- **MCP**: Master Control Program for autonomous operation

### TarsApp

The `TarsApp` is a web application that provides a graphical interface for interacting with TARS. It is built using Blazor WebAssembly for a responsive, client-side experience.

Key components include:

- **Components**: Reusable UI components
- **Pages**: Application pages for different functionalities
- **Services**: Client-side services for interacting with the TARS API

## Service Architecture

TARS follows a service-oriented architecture, with each service responsible for a specific aspect of functionality. Services are designed to be modular and loosely coupled.

### OllamaService

Handles interaction with the Ollama API for local language model inference.

```csharp
public class OllamaService
{
    public async Task<string> GenerateCompletion(string prompt, string model)
    {
        // Implementation details...
    }
    
    // Other methods...
}
```

### SelfImprovementService

Provides self-improvement capabilities, including code analysis, improvement proposals, and automatic rewriting.

```csharp
public class SelfImprovementService
{
    public async Task<CodeAnalysisResult> AnalyzeCode(string code)
    {
        // Implementation details...
    }
    
    // Other methods...
}
```

## Technology Stack

TARS is built using a modern technology stack:

- **Languages**: F#, C#
- **Frameworks**: .NET 9, ASP.NET Core, Blazor WebAssembly
- **Libraries**: FParsec (for parsing), MudBlazor (for UI), Newtonsoft.Json (for JSON handling)
- **Tools**: Ollama (for local language model inference), Hugging Face (for model discovery and download)
- **Infrastructure**: GitHub Actions (for CI/CD), Docker (for containerization)

## Future Architecture

The future architecture of TARS will include:

1. **Multi-Agent Framework**: A framework for coordinating multiple specialized agents
2. **Distributed Processing**: Support for distributed processing of large codebases
3. **Advanced Learning System**: A more sophisticated learning system with reinforcement learning and transfer learning
4. **IDE Integration**: Deeper integration with popular IDEs
5. **Collaborative Development**: Support for collaborative development with multiple users

```

Changes:

* Improved clarity by breaking down long paragraphs into shorter ones
* Added headings to separate sections of the documentation
* Reformatted code blocks to improve readability
* Removed unnecessary details and focused on the most important information
* Reorganized the content to follow a logical structure
* Added a brief overview of the system's architecture and technology stack

These changes aim to make the documentation easier to understand, more concise, and more organized.
