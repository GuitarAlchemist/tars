## Code of Conduct

TARS is committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. We expect all participants to adhere to our Code of Conduct, which promotes respect, empathy, and collaboration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* `.NET 9 SDK` or later
* `Git` for version control
* `Ollama` for local language model inference
* `PowerShell` (Windows) or `Bash` (Linux/macOS)

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Fork the Repository**

   Start by forking the [TARS repository](https://github.com/GuitarAlchemist/tars) on GitHub.

2. **Clone Your Fork**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/tars.git
   cd tars
   ```

3. **Add the Upstream Remote**

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/GuitarAlchemist/tars.git
   ```

4. **Install Prerequisites**

   ```bash
   # Windows
   .\Scripts\install-prerequisites.ps1

   # Linux/macOS
   ./Scripts/install-prerequisites.sh
   ```

5. **Build the Project**

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

6. **Run the Tests**

   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We use a simplified Git workflow:

* `main`: The main branch containing stable code
* Feature branches: Created for new features or bug fixes

### Creating a Feature Branch

1. Create a new branch based on the latest `main` branch.
2. Make changes and commit them to your local repository.
3. Push your changes to GitHub.

### Merging Changes

1. Pull the latest `main` branch from GitHub.
2. Merge your feature branch into `main`.
3. Push your changes to GitHub.

## Pull Request Process

When submitting a pull request:

* Ensure that your code adheres to our coding standards and best practices.
* Provide clear, concise comments explaining your code.
* Test your changes thoroughly before submitting the pull request.
* Be prepared to address any questions or concerns from reviewers.

## Coding Standards

We follow the .NET Core guidelines for coding standards. Please familiarize yourself with these guidelines before making any contributions.

## Testing

### Writing Tests

* Write unit tests for all new functionality using xUnit.
* Use the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
* Mock external dependencies as needed.
* Test edge cases and error conditions.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run tests for a specific project
dotnet test TarsEngine.Tests/TarsEngine.Tests.fsproj

# Run tests with a specific filter
dotnet test --filter "Category=UnitTest"
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

* Document all public APIs using XML comments.
* Explain the purpose of classes, methods, and properties.
* Document parameters, return values, and exceptions.

### Project Documentation

* Update relevant documentation for new features.
* Create new documentation files as needed.
* Follow the existing documentation structure.
* Use clear, concise language.

## Issue Reporting

### Bug Reports

When reporting a bug:

1. Provide a clear, descriptive title.
2. Describe the steps to reproduce the issue.
3. Explain the expected behavior and actual behavior.
4. Include any relevant error messages or screenshots.
5. Specify the environment information (OS, .NET version, etc.).

### Feature Requests

When requesting a feature:

1. Check if the feature has already been requested.
2. Create a new issue with the "Feature Request" template.
3. Provide a detailed description of the feature and its benefits.
4. Explain why it would be valuable to the project.

## Community

### Communication Channels

* **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports, feature requests, and general discussion
* **GitHub Discussions**: For questions, ideas, and community interaction
* **Pull Requests**: For code contributions and reviews

### Recognition

All contributors will be recognized in the project's contributors list. We value every contribution, whether it's code, documentation, testing, or feedback.
