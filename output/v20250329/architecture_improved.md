# TARS Technical Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the TARS architecture, including its components, interactions, and design principles.

## System Overview

TARS is built using a modular, service-oriented architecture that enables flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability. The system primarily uses F# for core engine components and C# for CLI and application interfaces.

## Core Components

### TarsEngine

The `TarsEngine` is the heart of the system, providing core reasoning, analysis, and improvement capabilities. It is implemented in F# to leverage its strong type system, pattern matching, and functional programming features.

Key modules include:

- **TarsEngine.Interfaces**: Shared interfaces for system components
- **TarsEngine.SelfImprovement**: F# module for self-improvement capabilities
- **TarsEngineFSharp**: Core F# implementation of the engine

### TarsCli

The `TarsCli` is a command-line interface for interacting with TARS. It provides commands for various operations, including code analysis, improvement, and language model management.

Key components include:

- **Command Handlers**: Handlers for CLI commands
- **Services**: Services for various functionalities
- **MCP**: Master Control Program for autonomous operation

### TarsApp

The `TarsApp` is a web application that provides a graphical interface for interacting with TARS. It is built using Blazor WebAssembly for a responsive, client-side experience.

Key components include:

- **Components**: Reusable UI components
- **Pages**: Application pages for different functionalities
- **Services**: Client-side services for interacting with the TARS API

## Service Architecture

TARS follows a service-oriented architecture, with each service responsible for a specific aspect of functionality. Services are designed to be modular and loosely coupled.

### OllamaService

Handles interaction with the Ollama API for local language model inference.
