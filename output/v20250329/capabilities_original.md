# TARS Core Capabilities

TARS offers a wide range of capabilities designed to enhance the software development process. This document provides an overview of these capabilities and how they can benefit your development workflow.

## Code Analysis and Improvement

### Self-Analysis

TARS can analyze code to identify potential issues, including:

- Magic numbers and hardcoded values
- Inefficient string operations
- Empty catch blocks
- Unused variables
- Mutable variables in F# (when immutable alternatives exist)
- Imperative loops in F# (when functional alternatives exist)
- Long methods
- TODO comments

```bash
tarscli self-analyze --file path/to/file.cs --model llama3
```

### Improvement Proposals

Based on its analysis, TARS can propose specific improvements to address identified issues:

- Replacing magic numbers with named constants
- Converting string concatenation to StringBuilder
- Adding proper error handling to catch blocks
- Removing or utilizing unused variables
- Converting mutable variables to immutable in F#
- Replacing imperative loops with functional alternatives in F#
- Breaking down long methods into smaller, more focused methods
- Implementing TODO items

```bash
tarscli self-propose --file path/to/file.cs --model codellama:13b-code
```

### Automatic Rewriting

TARS can automatically apply proposed improvements to your code, with options for manual review or automatic acceptance:

```bash
tarscli self-rewrite --file path/to/file.cs --model codellama:13b-code --auto-apply
```

## Master Control Program (MCP)

### Autonomous Operation

The Master Control Program (MCP) enables TARS to operate autonomously, executing commands and generating code without requiring manual confirmation for each action.

### Code Generation

TARS can generate code based on natural language descriptions or specifications:

```bash
tarscli mcp code path/to/file.cs "public class MyClass { }"
```

### Triple-Quoted Syntax

For multi-line code blocks, TARS supports triple-quoted syntax:

```bash
tarscli mcp triple-code path/to/file.cs """
using System;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
"""
```

### Terminal Command Execution

TARS can execute terminal commands without requiring permission prompts:

```bash
tarscli mcp execute "echo Hello, World!"
```

## Language Model Integration

### Hugging Face Integration

TARS can browse, download, and install the best coding language models from Hugging Face:

```bash
# Find the best coding models
tarscli huggingface best --limit 3

# Get details about a specific model
tarscli huggingface details --model microsoft/phi-2

# Install a model for use with TARS
tarscli huggingface install --model microsoft/phi-2 --name phi2
```

### Local Model Support

TARS works with locally installed models through Ollama, providing:

- Automatic model installation and management
- Efficient inference with local models
- Support for a wide range of model architectures

## Language Specifications

TARS can generate formal language specifications for its DSL:

```bash
# Generate EBNF specification
tarscli language ebnf --output tars_grammar.ebnf

# Generate BNF specification
tarscli language bnf --output tars_grammar.bnf

# Generate JSON schema
tarscli language json-schema --output tars_schema.json

# Generate markdown documentation
tarscli language docs --output tars_dsl_docs.md
```

## Workflow Automation

### Task Processing

TARS can process files through a retroaction loop, applying AI-powered improvements:

```bash
tarscli process --file path/to/file.cs --task "Refactor this code"
```

### Documentation Processing

TARS can process documentation files, improving clarity and consistency:

```bash
tarscli docs --task "Improve documentation clarity"
```

### Demo Capabilities

TARS includes a demo command to showcase its capabilities:

```bash
# Run all demos
tarscli demo

# Run a specific demo
tarscli demo --type self-improvement --model llama3

# Run code generation demo
tarscli demo --type code-generation
```

### Multi-Agent Workflows

TARS supports multi-agent workflows for complex tasks:

```bash
tarscli workflow --task "Create a simple web API in C#"
```

## Learning and Adaptation

### Learning Database

TARS maintains a learning database that records improvements and feedback, allowing it to:

- Track the history of improvements
- Learn from successful and unsuccessful improvements
- Adapt its recommendations based on past experiences

```bash
tarscli learning stats
tarscli learning events --count 5
```

### Template Management

TARS supports template management for reusing common patterns:

```bash
tarscli template list
tarscli template create --name my_template.json --file path/to/template.json
```

## Integration Capabilities

### Session Management

TARS supports session management for maintaining context across multiple commands:

```bash
tarscli init my-session
tarscli run --session my-session my-plan.fsx
tarscli trace --session my-session last
```

### Diagnostics

TARS includes comprehensive diagnostics for troubleshooting and monitoring:

```bash
tarscli diagnostics
```

## Use Cases

TARS is designed to support a wide range of use cases, including:

1. **Code Refactoring**: Automatically identify and fix code issues
2. **Documentation Improvement**: Enhance clarity and consistency in documentation
3. **Learning and Exploration**: Learn best practices and patterns from TARS recommendations
4. **Workflow Automation**: Automate complex development workflows
5. **Knowledge Capture**: Capture and apply domain-specific knowledge
6. **Collaborative Development**: Work alongside TARS as a development partner
