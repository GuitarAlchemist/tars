# TARS Core Capabilities

TARS offers a wide range of capabilities designed to enhance the software development process. This document provides an overview of these capabilities and how they can benefit your development workflow.

## Code Analysis and Improvement

### Self-Analysis

TARS can analyze code to identify potential issues, including:

* Magic numbers and hardcoded values
* Inefficient string operations
* Empty catch blocks
* Unused variables
* Mutable variables in F# (when immutable alternatives exist)
* Imperative loops in F# (when functional alternatives exist)
* Long methods
* TODO comments

To perform self-analysis:
```bash
tarscli self-analyze --file path/to/file.cs --model llama3
```

### Improvement Proposals

Based on its analysis, TARS can propose specific improvements to address identified issues:

* Replacing magic numbers with named constants
* Converting string concatenation to StringBuilder
* Adding proper error handling to catch blocks
* Removing or utilizing unused variables
* Converting mutable variables to immutable in F#
* Replacing imperative loops with functional alternatives in F#
* Breaking down long methods into smaller, more focused methods
* Implementing TODO items

To view proposed improvements:
```bash
tarscli self-propose --file path/to/file.cs --model codellama:13b-code
```

### Automatic Rewriting

TARS can automatically apply proposed improvements to your code, with options for manual review or automatic acceptance:

```bash
tarscli self-rewrite --file path/to/file.cs --model codellama:13b-code --auto-apply
```

## Master Control Program (MCP)

### Autonomous Operation

The Master Control Program (MCP) enables TARS to operate autonomously, executing commands and generating code without requiring manual confirmation for each action.

### Code Generation

TARS can generate code based on natural language descriptions or specifications:

```bash
tarscli mcp code path/to/file.cs "public class MyClass { }"
```

### Triple-Quoted Syntax

For multi-line code blocks, TARS supports triple-quoted syntax:

```bash
tarscli mcp triple-code path/to/file.cs """
using System;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
"""
```

### Terminal Command Execution

TARS can execute terminal commands without requiring permission prompts:

```bash
tarscli mcp execute "echo Hello, World!"
```

## Language Model Integration

### Hugging Face Integration

TARS can browse, download, and install the best coding language models from Hugging Face:

```bash
# Find the best coding models
tarscli huggingface best --limit 3

# Get details about a specific model
tarscli huggingface details --model microsoft/phi-2

# Install a model for use with TARS
tarscli huggingface install --model microsoft/phi-2 --name phi2
```

### Local Model Support

TARS works with locally installed models through Ollama, providing:

* Automatic model installation and management
* Efficient inference with local models
* Support for a wide range of model architectures

## Language Specifications

TARS can generate formal language specifications for its DSL:

```bash
# Generate EBNF specification
tarscli language ebnf --output tars_grammar.ebnf

# Generate BNF specification
tarscli language bnf --output tars_grammar.bnf

# Generate JSON specification
tarscli language json --output tars_spec.json
```

## Use Cases

TARS is designed to support a wide range of use cases, including:

1. **Code Refactoring**: Automatically identify and fix code issues
2. **Documentation Improvement**: Enhance clarity and consistency in documentation
3. **Learning and Exploration**: Learn best practices and patterns from TARS recommendations
4. **Workflow Automation**: Automate complex development workflows
5. **Knowledge Capture**: Capture and apply domain-specific knowledge
6. **Collaborative Development**: Work alongside TARS as a development partner

Changes made:

* Improved headings and formatting for better readability
* Reorganized sections to make it easier to find specific information
* Added brief descriptions to each section to provide context
* Standardized code blocks using triple backticks ````
* Reformatted code blocks to improve readability
* Removed unnecessary whitespace and indentation
