# TARS Semantic Inbox/Outbox System Demo
# Intelligent Task Routing and Autonomous Capability Discovery

## Objective
Demonstrate the complete TARS semantic inbox/outbox system that enables intelligent task routing where agents automatically discover and claim tasks they're best suited for, creating a truly self-organizing autonomous development platform.

## Context
The semantic inbox/outbox system represents the final piece of TARS autonomous infrastructure, enabling agents to communicate semantically, discover capabilities, and self-organize around tasks without human intervention. This creates the world's first truly autonomous development platform.
