```

#### Step 2: Agent Orchestration Demo
```bash
# List available agents
tars agents list

# Start specific agents
tars agents start RequirementsAgent
tars agents start AnalyticsAgent
tars agents start ClosureFactoryAgent

# Monitor agent health
tars agents health
```

#### Step 3: Autonomous Requirements Generation
```bash
# Trigger autonomous requirement analysis
tars requirements analyze --project "E-Commerce Platform"

# Auto-detect requirement gaps
tars requirements gaps --analyze-existing

# Generate test cases automatically
tars requirements tests --auto-generate
```

#### Step 4: Closure Factory Demonstration
```bash
# Create REST API closure
tars closures create rest-api "Product API" --endpoints "products,categories,orders"

# Generate infrastructure closure
tars closures create infrastructure "E-Commerce Stack" --components "redis,mongodb,nginx"

# Create data processing closure
tars closures create data-processor "Order Analytics" --sources "orders.csv,customers.json"

# Execute closure dynamically
tars closures execute "Product API" --output "./generated/product-api"
```

#### Step 5: Real-Time Analytics Dashboard
```bash
# View real-time system metrics
tars analytics dashboard

# Generate performance report
tars analytics report --period "last-24h"

# View predictive analysis
