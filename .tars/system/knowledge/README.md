## 📖 Knowledge Management

### Knowledge Extraction
The TARS knowledge system can automatically extract knowledge from:
- Documentation files (Markdown, text)
- Code comments and documentation
- Configuration files
- Log files and reports
- External knowledge sources

### Knowledge Application
Knowledge is applied through:
- Problem-solving assistance
- Code generation guidance
- Architecture recommendations
- Best practice suggestions
- Automated improvements

### Knowledge Validation
All knowledge items include:
- Confidence scores (0.0 - 1.0)
- Source attribution
- Last updated timestamps
- Validation status
- Usage statistics

## 🚀 Using the Knowledge Base

### CLI Commands
```bash
# Extract knowledge from documentation
tars knowledge extract docs/

# Apply knowledge to solve a problem
tars knowledge apply "How to optimize F# performance?"

# Build comprehensive knowledge base
tars knowledge build docs/ src/ examples/
```

### Programmatic Access
```fsharp
// Access knowledge service
let knowledgeService = serviceProvider.GetService<KnowledgeApplicationService>()

// Extract knowledge
let! knowledgeItems = knowledgeService.ExtractKnowledgeFromDocumentationAsync("docs/")

// Apply knowledge to problem
let! solution = knowledgeService.ApplyKnowledgeToProblemsAsync("optimization problem", knowledgeItems)
```

## 📊 Knowledge Metrics

### Quality Metrics
- **Accuracy**: How correct the knowledge is
- **Relevance**: How applicable to current problems
- **Completeness**: How comprehensive the coverage is
- **Freshness**: How up-to-date the knowledge is

### Usage Metrics
- **Access Frequency**: How often knowledge is used
- **Success Rate**: How often knowledge solves problems
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on knowledge quality
- **Improvement Rate**: How knowledge evolves over time

## 🔄 Knowledge Evolution

The TARS knowledge base continuously evolves through:
- **Autonomous Learning**: System learns from usage patterns
- **User Feedback**: Incorporates user corrections and additions
- **External Sources**: Integrates new knowledge from external sources
- **Validation Loops**: Continuously validates and updates knowledge
