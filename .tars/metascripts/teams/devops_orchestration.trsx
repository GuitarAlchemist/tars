## Agent Workflows

### CI/CD Agent Workflow
```fsharp
// CI/CD Pipeline Management
let manageCIPipeline projectPath =
    async {
        // Analyze project structure
        let! projectAnalysis = analyzeProjectStructure projectPath
        
        // Generate pipeline configuration
        let pipelineConfig = generatePipelineConfig projectAnalysis
        
        // Create Docker configuration
        let dockerConfig = generateDockerConfig projectAnalysis
        
        // Setup GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps
        let! ciSetup = setupContinuousIntegration pipelineConfig
        
        // Configure automated testing
        let! testSetup = setupAutomatedTesting projectAnalysis
        
        return {
            PipelineConfig = pipelineConfig
            DockerConfig = dockerConfig
            CISetup = ciSetup
            TestSetup = testSetup
        }
    }
```

### Deployment Agent Workflow
```fsharp
// Deployment Automation
let manageDeployment deploymentTarget =
    async {
        // Validate deployment readiness
        let! readinessCheck = validateDeploymentReadiness deploymentTarget
        
        if readinessCheck.IsReady then
            // Execute deployment strategy
            let! deploymentResult = executeDeployment deploymentTarget
            
            // Verify deployment health
            let! healthCheck = verifyDeploymentHealth deploymentTarget
            
            // Setup monitoring and alerts
            let! monitoringSetup = setupDeploymentMonitoring deploymentTarget
            
            return {
                DeploymentResult = deploymentResult
                HealthCheck = healthCheck
                MonitoringSetup = monitoringSetup
            }
        else
            return { Error = "Deployment readiness check failed" }
    }
```

### Monitoring Agent Workflow
```fsharp
// System Monitoring and Alerting
let setupMonitoring systemConfig =
    async {
        // Configure metrics collection
        let! metricsSetup = setupMetricsCollection systemConfig
        
        // Setup alerting rules
        let alertingRules = generateAlertingRules systemConfig
        
        // Configure dashboards
        let! dashboardSetup = setupMonitoringDashboards systemConfig
        
        // Setup log aggregation
        let! loggingSetup = setupLogAggregation systemConfig
        
        return {
            MetricsSetup = metricsSetup
            AlertingRules = alertingRules
            DashboardSetup = dashboardSetup
            LoggingSetup = loggingSetup
        }
    }
```

### Security Agent Workflow
```fsharp
// Security Scanning and Compliance
let performSecurityAudit projectPath =
    async {
        // Scan for vulnerabilities
        let! vulnerabilityReport = scanForVulnerabilities projectPath
        
        // Check compliance requirements
        let! complianceReport = checkCompliance projectPath
        
        // Analyze dependencies
        let! dependencyAudit = auditDependencies projectPath
        
        // Generate security recommendations
        let securityRecommendations = generateSecurityRecommendations [
            vulnerabilityReport
            complianceReport
            dependencyAudit
        ]
        
        return {
            VulnerabilityReport = vulnerabilityReport
            ComplianceReport = complianceReport
            DependencyAudit = dependencyAudit
            SecurityRecommendations = securityRecommendations
        }
    }
```

## Team Coordination Logic
```fsharp
// DevOps Team Orchestration
let orchestrateDevOpsTeam projectPath =
    async {
        printfn "🚀 DevOps Team: Starting infrastructure orchestration..."
        
        // Parallel execution of team workflows
        let! results = Async.Parallel [
            manageCIPipeline projectPath
            setupMonitoring { ProjectPath = projectPath }
            performSecurityAudit projectPath
        ]
        
        let [ciResult; monitoringResult; securityResult] = results |> Array.toList
        
        // Coordinate deployment based on results
        if securityResult.IsSecure && ciResult.IsReady then
            let! deploymentResult = manageDeployment {
                ProjectPath = projectPath
                CIConfig = ciResult
                SecurityConfig = securityResult
                MonitoringConfig = monitoringResult
            }
            
            printfn "✅ DevOps Team: Infrastructure orchestration completed successfully"
            return {
                CIResult = ciResult
                MonitoringResult = monitoringResult
                SecurityResult = securityResult
                DeploymentResult = Some deploymentResult
            }
        else
            printfn "⚠️ DevOps Team: Deployment blocked due to security or CI issues"
            return {
                CIResult = ciResult
                MonitoringResult = monitoringResult
                SecurityResult = securityResult
                DeploymentResult = None
            }
    }
```
