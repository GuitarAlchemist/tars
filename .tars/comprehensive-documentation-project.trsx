REASONING:
  This comprehensive documentation project leverages TARS's autonomous capabilities
  and departmental organization to create world-class documentation while running
  as a background service. The project ensures minimal impact on system performance
  while delivering professional-grade documentation that covers all aspects of TARS
  from user guides to technical specifications. The autonomous generation approach
  ensures consistency, completeness, and continuous updates as TARS evolves.

EXPECTED_OUTCOMES:
  - Complete documentation ecosystem for TARS
  - Reduced onboarding time for new users
  - Enhanced user experience and adoption
  - Professional enterprise-ready documentation
  - Autonomous documentation maintenance system
