**Generated:** 2025-05-31 21:28:29
**Ecosystem Health:** 0.0%
**Analysis Type:** Autonomous Metascript Execution

## Executive Summary

The TARS agent ecosystem shows 0% health with critical architectural gaps identified. 
The primary systemic issue is a fundamental mismatch between user expectations (runnable applications) 
and system capabilities (project scaffolding). This requires architectural refactoring rather than bug fixes.

## Agent Discovery Results

- **Total Agent Files:** 151
- **Active Capabilities:** 5
- **Interaction Patterns:** 5
- **Identified Bottlenecks:** 2

## Critical Capability Gaps

### ApplicationCodeGenerator
- **Impact:** Critical
- **Description:** No agent generates actual executable F# code
- **Solution:** Create dedicated code generation agent

## Systemic Issues

### Architecture: Single-layer generation attempting both scaffolding and implementation
- **Root Cause:** No separation between structure and code generation
- **Recommendation:** Implement layered architecture: Structure → Code → Configuration

### Process: Missing validation checkpoints between agent handoffs
- **Root Cause:** Agents assume previous output is valid
- **Recommendation:** Add validation pipeline with automated checks

### Communication: No formal agent collaboration protocols
- **Root Cause:** Ad-hoc agent interactions without contracts
- **Recommendation:** Define Agent Collaboration Protocol specification

## Autonomous Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical)
- Create ApplicationCodeGenerator agent immediately
- Add Program.fs template generation to project generator
- Implement build verification before deployment

### Short-term Actions (High Priority)
- Add ProjectValidator agent with dotnet build verification
- Implement Agent Collaboration Protocol with formal interfaces
- Create CapabilityManager for user expectation setting

### Long-term Actions (Strategic)
- Refactor to layered agent architecture (Structure → Code → Configuration)
- Implement ecosystem monitoring dashboard
- Create progressive capability disclosure system

## Ecosystem Health Metrics

- **Overall Health:** 0.0%
- **Capability Maturity:** 40%
- **Critical Gaps:** 1
- **Systemic Issues:** 3
