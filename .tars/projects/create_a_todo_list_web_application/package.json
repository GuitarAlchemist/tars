This file includes the necessary dependencies for building a todo list web application using Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, Passport.js, and React. The `scripts` section defines two scripts: `start`, which runs the main application entry point, and `test`, which runs Jest tests.

Note that you may need to adjust the versions of the dependencies to match your specific requirements or project constraints.
