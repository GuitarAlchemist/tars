Here is the complete `package.json` file content:

```json
{
  "name": "note-taking-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "redux": "^4.1.1",
    "react-redux": "^7.2.5"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/index.js",
    "build": "webpack --mode production src/index.js"
  }
}
```

This file specifies the project name, version, and dependencies required for the note-taking app. The `dependencies` object lists the necessary packages, including Express.js, Body-Parser, React, React-DOM, Redux, and React-Redux. The `scripts` object defines two scripts: `start`, which runs the Node.js server using the `src/index.js` file, and `build`, which compiles the React app using Webpack in production mode.

Note that this is just a starting point, and you may need to add or modify dependencies as your project evolves.
