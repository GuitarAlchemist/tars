Here is the complete, functional code for the `index.js` file:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import App from './containers/App';
import noteReducer from './reducers/noteReducer';
import noteActions from './actions/noteActions';

const store = createStore(combineReducers({ notes: noteReducer }));

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

// Add error handling here if needed
```

This code sets up the Redux store and connects it to the `App` component, which is defined in a separate file (`containers/App.js`). The `noteReducer` and `noteActions` are also defined separately in their respective files (`reducers/noteReducer.js` and `actions/noteActions.js`).

Note that this code assumes you have already set up the project structure as described in the analysis, with the necessary directories and files created.
