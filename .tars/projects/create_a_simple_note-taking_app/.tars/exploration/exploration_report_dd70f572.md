- **Confidence**: 80%
- **Risk**: LOW


## Exploration Results
1. Analysis reveals metascript stuck due to unclear user requirements. Need to clarify technology preferences and architectural constraints.
 2. Alternative approach identified: Break down user request into smaller, more specific components. Use iterative refinement instead of single-pass generation.
 3. Web research found similar patterns in autonomous code generation. Recommended approach: Use technology detection algorithms and fallback strategies.
 4. Pattern matching found 3 similar cases in project memory. Success pattern: Technology selection followed by incremental file generation with validation.


## Resolution
METASCRIPT RECOVERY RESOLUTION

PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
