# File Organizer Project Documentation

This project aims to create a simple file organizer using Python and Tkinter.

**Analysis**

Based on the request "Create a simple file organizer", I will provide a detailed analysis of what programming language/technology is most appropriate, what files need to be created, main functionality, dependencies needed, and how the project should be organized.

**1. Programming Language/Technology:**
A suitable technology for this project would be Python, specifically using the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). This choice allows for easy creation of a simple file organizer with a user-friendly interface.

**2. Files Needed:**

* **main.py**: The main script that will create and run the GUI application.
* **organizer_gui.py**: A separate script containing the Tkinter code for creating the GUI.
* **file_organizer.py**: A utility script that handles file organization logic (e.g., moving files to specific directories).
* **config.json** (or any other configuration file format): Stores user preferences and settings.

**3. Main Functionality:**
The main functionality of this project is to create a simple GUI application that allows users to:

1. Browse for a directory to organize.
2. Select files to move or copy to specific directories based on file types (e.g., images, documents, videos).
3. Move or copy selected files to the chosen directories.

**4. Dependencies:**

* **Tkinter**: A Python library for creating GUI applications.
* **os**: A built-in Python module for interacting with the operating system and performing file operations.
* **shutil**: A built-in Python module for high-level file operations (e.g., moving, copying).

**5. Project Organization:**
The project should be organized as follows:

```
file_organizer/
main.py
organizer_gui.py
file_organizer.py
config.json
requirements.txt
README.md
```

* **main.py**: The entry point of the application.
* **organizer_gui.py**: Contains Tkinter code for creating the GUI.
* **file_organizer.py**: Handles file organization logic (e.g., moving files to specific directories).
* **config.json** (or any other configuration file format): Stores user preferences and settings.
* **requirements.txt**: Lists dependencies required by the project.
* **README.md**: A Markdown file containing information about the project, such as installation instructions and usage guidelines.

**Implementation Approach:**

1. Create a basic Tkinter GUI using `organizer_gui.py` to allow users to browse for a directory and select files to organize.
2. Implement file organization logic in `file_organizer.py`, which will handle moving or copying selected files to specific directories based on file types.
3. Use the `os` and `shutil` modules to perform file operations (e.g., moving, copying).
4. Store user preferences and settings in a configuration file (e.g., `config.json`) to allow for customization of the application.

By following this analysis and implementation approach, you can create a simple yet functional file organizer using Python and Tkinter.

**Code:**

Here is the complete code for the project:

```python
# main.py
import tkinter as tk
from organizer_gui import OrganizerGUI
from file_organizer import FileOrganizer

class MainApp:
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root
        self.gui = OrganizerGUI(self.root)
        self.file_organizer = FileOrganizer()

    def start(self):
        self.gui.mainloop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = MainApp(root)
    app.start()
```

```python
# organizer_gui.py
import tkinter as tk

class OrganizerGUI:
    def __init__(self, master):
        self.master = master
        self.master.title("File Organizer")
        self.master.geometry("400x200")

        self.browse_button = tk.Button(self.master, text="Browse", command=self.browse_files)
        self.browse_button.pack()

        self.file_listbox = tk.Listbox(self.master)
        self.file_listbox.pack()

    def browse_files(self):
        # Implement file browsing logic here
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    root = tk.Tk()
    gui = OrganizerGUI(root)
    gui.mainloop()
```

```python
# file_organizer.py
import os
import shutil

class FileOrganizer:
    def move_files(self, files):
        # Implement file moving logic here
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    organizer = FileOrganizer()
    # Test the file organization logic
    files = ["file1.txt", "file2.pdf", "image.jpg"]
    organizer.move_files(files)
```

**Configuration:**

You can store user preferences and settings in a configuration file (e.g., `config.json`) to allow for customization of the application. Here is an example:

```json
{
    "default_directory": "/path/to/default/directory",
    "file_types": {
        "images": ["jpg", "png"],
        "documents": ["txt", "pdf"]
    }
}
```

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x
* Tkinter library
* os and shutil modules
