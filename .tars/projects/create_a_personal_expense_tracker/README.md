**Project Documentation and Usage Instructions**

**Personal Expense Tracker**

**Analysis**

### 1. Programming Language/Technology:

A suitable technology for a personal expense tracker is a web-based application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a backend framework like Node.js with Express.js. This allows for a user-friendly interface, easy data storage, and scalability.

### 2. File Structure:

The project will consist of the following files:

* `index.html`: The main entry point for the web application.
* `styles.css`: A CSS file for styling the UI components.
* `script.js`: A JavaScript file for handling user interactions and making API calls.
* `server.js`: The Node.js server file that handles requests, stores data, and provides API endpoints.
* `models/expense.js`: A JavaScript file defining the expense model with properties like date, category, amount, and description.
* `routes/api.js`: A JavaScript file defining API routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting expenses.
* `public/index.html`: A simple HTML file for serving static assets (e.g., images).
* `package.json`: The project's package file that lists dependencies and scripts.

### 3. Main Functionality:

The personal expense tracker should have the following features:

1. User authentication (username and password) to secure user data.
2. Expense tracking:
	* Create: Allow users to add new expenses with date, category, amount, and description.
	* Read: Display a list of all expenses, including filters for date range and categories.
	* Update: Enable editing of existing expenses.
	* Delete: Allow deleting of expenses.
3. Data visualization: Display expense data in a chart or graph to help users understand their spending habits.

### 4. Dependencies:

The project will require the following dependencies:

1. Express.js (for building the Node.js server)
2. Mongoose (for interacting with MongoDB for storing and retrieving data)
3. Passport.js (for user authentication)
4. Chart.js (for creating charts and graphs)

### 5. Project Organization:

* `src/`: The source code directory containing all JavaScript files.
	+ `models/`: Directory for expense models.
	+ `routes/`: Directory for API routes.
* `public/`: The public directory for serving static assets.
* `node_modules/`: The directory where dependencies are installed.
* `.gitignore`: A file specifying which files and directories should be ignored by Git.

### Implementation Approach:

1. Set up the project structure using Node.js and Express.js.
2. Create the expense model using Mongoose and define API routes for CRUD operations.
3. Implement user authentication using Passport.js.
4. Develop the UI components using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (in `script.js`).
5. Integrate the API endpoints with the UI components to enable expense tracking features.
6. Add data visualization using Chart.js.

By following this analysis, you'll have a solid foundation for building a personal expense tracker that is scalable, secure, and user-friendly.
