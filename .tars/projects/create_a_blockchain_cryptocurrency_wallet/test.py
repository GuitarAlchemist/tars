Here is the complete `test.py` file:

```python
import unittest
from wallet import Wallet, Transaction

class TestWallet(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.wallet = Wallet()

    def test_wallet_creation(self):
        self.assertIsNotNone(self.wallet.private_key)
        self.assertIsNotNone(self.wallet.public_address)

    def test_transaction_processing(self):
        transaction = Transaction(self.wallet.public_address, "recipient", 1.0)
        self.wallet.send_transaction(transaction)
        self.assertTrue(len(self.wallet.transactions) > 0)

    def test_blockchain_interaction(self):
        # This test will require a blockchain network and a valid connection
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This file contains unit tests for the `Wallet` class, which is responsible for managing cryptocurrency transactions. The tests cover wallet creation, transaction processing, and blockchain interaction.

Note that this code assumes you have a `wallet.py` file with a `Wallet` class and a `Transaction` class defined in it. You will need to create these classes and implement their methods according to your specific requirements.

Also, the test for blockchain interaction is currently empty because it requires a valid connection to a blockchain network, which can be complex to set up. You may want to consider using a testing framework that allows you to mock or stub out this functionality for the purposes of unit testing.
