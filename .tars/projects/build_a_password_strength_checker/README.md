Project: Password Strength Checker
=====================================

File Purpose:
-------------

This project aims to create a password strength checker that allows users to input a password and calculates its strength based on factors like length, complexity, and common password patterns. The application will display the calculated strength as a visual indicator and provide feedback to the user about the strengths and weaknesses of their chosen password.

**Analysis**
------------

### 1. Programming Language/Technology:

The most appropriate programming language for this project is JavaScript, specifically using a modern framework like React or Vue.js to create a web-based password strength checker. This choice allows for easy integration with HTML and CSS, making it suitable for a web application.

### 2. File Structure:

* **Directory Structure:**
	+ `password-strength-checker/`
		- `src/` (source code)
			- `components/` (reusable UI components)
			- `utils/` (utility functions)
			- `main.js` (entry point for the application)
		- `public/` (static assets, e.g., images, fonts)
		- `index.html` (main HTML file)

### 3. Main Functionality:

The password strength checker should:

* Allow users to input a password
* Calculate the strength of the entered password based on factors like length, complexity, and common password patterns
* Display the calculated strength as a visual indicator (e.g., a progress bar or a color-coded rating system)
* Provide feedback to the user about the strengths and weaknesses of their chosen password

### 4. Dependencies:

The project will require:

* A JavaScript library for password strength calculation, such as `zxcvbn` or `password-strength`
* A CSS framework like Bootstrap or Materialize for styling
* A React/Vue.js framework for building the UI components

### 5. Implementation Approach:

1. Create a new React/Vue.js project using a template or by initializing a new project with a CLI tool.
2. Design and implement the `PasswordInput` component to handle user input.
3. Develop the `passwordStrengthChecker` utility function to calculate the strength of a given password.
4. Implement the main functionality in `main.js`, which will render the UI, handle user interactions, and display the calculated strength.
5. Style the application using CSS and a chosen framework (e.g., Bootstrap or Materialize).
6. Integrate the JavaScript library for password strength calculation into the project.

**Code**
------

Here is the complete code for the project:

```javascript
// src/components/PasswordInput.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const PasswordInput = () => {
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [strength, setStrength] = useState('');

  const handleInputChange = (event) => {
    setPassword(event.target.value);
  };

  const calculateStrength = () => {
    // Call the password strength calculation library here
    const strengthLevel = zxcvbn.passwordStrength(password);
    setStrength(strengthLevel);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="password" value={password} onChange={handleInputChange} />
      <p>Strength: {strength}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default PasswordInput;
```

```javascript
// src/utils/passwordStrengthChecker.js
import zxcvbn from 'zxcvbn';

const passwordStrengthChecker = (password) => {
  const strengthLevel = zxcvbn.passwordStrength(password);
  return strengthLevel;
};

export default passwordStrengthChecker;
```

```javascript
// src/main.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import PasswordInput from './PasswordInput';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <PasswordInput />
    </div>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

**Error Handling**
----------------

* Handle errors when calculating the password strength
* Display error messages to the user if there are any issues with the input or calculation

**Best Practices**
-------------------

* Follow React/Vue.js best practices for component structure and organization
* Use a consistent coding style throughout the project
* Test the application thoroughly before deployment
