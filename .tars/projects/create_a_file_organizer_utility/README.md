Here is the complete `README.md` file with working content:

**File Organizer Utility README**

Project Purpose: Create a utility that helps users categorize and manage their files.

**Analysis**

The request is to create a "file organizer utility" that helps users categorize and manage their files. Based on this requirement, I will provide a detailed analysis of the project structure needed.

**1. Programming Language/Technology:**
A suitable programming language for this project would be Python, as it has excellent support for file operations, GUI development (using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt), and is easy to learn. Additionally, Python's simplicity and flexibility make it an ideal choice for a utility-focused project.

**2. Files Needed:**

* `main.py`: The main entry point of the application, responsible for initializing the GUI and handling user interactions.
* `organizer_gui.py`: A separate file containing the GUI implementation using Tkinter or PyQt.
* `file_operations.py`: A module that handles file-related tasks, such as reading, writing, and moving files.
* `config.py`: A configuration file to store settings and preferences for the application (e.g., default folder paths).
* `requirements.txt`: A file listing the dependencies required by the project.

**3. Main Functionality:**
The main functionality of the file organizer utility should include:

* File categorization: Users can select files and categorize them into folders based on specific criteria (e.g., file type, date modified, or custom tags).
* Folder management: The application should allow users to create, rename, and delete folders.
* File movement: Users can move files between categories or folders.
* Search functionality: A search bar that allows users to find files by name, content, or metadata.

**4. Dependencies:**

* `tkinter` (or `pyqt`) for GUI development
* `os` for file system operations
* `shutil` for moving and copying files
* `datetime` for date-related calculations

**5. Project Organization:**
The project should be organized into the following directories:

```markdown
file_organizer_utility/
src/
main.py
organizer_gui.py
file_operations.py
config.py
requirements.txt
config/
config.py
requirements/
requirements.txt
tests/
test_file_operations.py
test_gui.py
...
```

**Implementation Approach:**

1. Start by setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files.
2. Implement the GUI using Tkinter or PyQt, focusing on creating a user-friendly interface for file categorization and management.
3. Develop the `file_operations` module to handle file-related tasks, such as reading, writing, and moving files.
4. Implement the main functionality, including file categorization, folder management, and search functionality.
5. Write unit tests to ensure the application's functionality and stability.

Here is a sample implementation of the project:

```python
# main.py
import tkinter as tk
from organizer_gui import OrganizerGUI

class FileOrganizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = tk.Tk()
        self.gui = OrganizerGUI(self.root)

    def run(self):
        self.root.mainloop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = FileOrganizer()
    app.run()
```

```python
# organizer_gui.py
import tkinter as tk

class OrganizerGUI:
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root
        self.frame = tk.Frame(self.root)
        self.frame.pack()

        # Create GUI elements (e.g., buttons, labels, text boxes)

    def create_file_listbox(self):
        # Create a list box to display files
        pass

    def create_folder_listbox(self):
        # Create a list box to display folders
        pass

# file_operations.py
import os
import shutil

class FileOperations:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def move_file(self, source_path, destination_path):
        # Move the file from the source path to the destination path
        shutil.move(source_path, destination_path)

    def create_folder(self, folder_path):
        # Create a new folder at the specified path
        os.makedirs(folder_path)
```

**Note:** This is just a sample implementation and may not cover all the requirements mentioned in this README. You will need to modify and expand on this code to complete the project.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
