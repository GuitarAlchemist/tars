Here is the complete, functional code for the `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Simple Calculator Web App</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="calculator-app"></div>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

This code sets up the basic HTML structure for our calculator web app, including a `<div>` element to serve as the container for our React application. We also link to our CSS file (`styles.css`) and include our JavaScript file (`app.js`).

Please note that you will need to create the following files:

* `app.js`: This is where we'll write our React code.
* `Calculator.js`, `Button.js`, and `Display.js`: These are reusable React components for our calculator app.
* `styles.css`: This is where we'll define our CSS styles for our components.

Here's a brief overview of what each file should contain:

* `app.js`:
	+ Import the necessary dependencies (e.g., React, React DOM).
	+ Define the main application component (`CalculatorApp`) that renders our calculator UI.
	+ Use JSX to render the calculator UI, including the display area and input buttons.
* `Calculator.js`, `Button.js`, and `Display.js`:
	+ Import the necessary dependencies (e.g., React).
	+ Define reusable React components for the calculator app (e.g., `Calculator`, `Button`, `Display`).
	+ Use JSX to define the component's UI and behavior.
* `styles.css`:
	+ Define CSS styles for our components, including layout, typography, and colors.

Remember to follow best practices for your chosen technology stack, such as using a linter and a code formatter.
