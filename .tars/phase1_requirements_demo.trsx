### Demo Scenario: E-Commerce Platform Requirements

#### Step 1: Initialize Requirements Database
```bash
tars requirements init
```

#### Step 2: Create Core Requirements
```bash
# Functional Requirements
tars requirements create "User Registration" "Users must be able to create accounts with email verification" functional

tars requirements create "Product Catalog" "System must display products with search and filter capabilities" functional

tars requirements create "Shopping Cart" "Users must be able to add, remove, and modify items in cart" functional

tars requirements create "Payment Processing" "System must securely process credit card payments" functional

# Performance Requirements  
tars requirements create "Page Load Time" "All pages must load within 2 seconds under normal load" performance

tars requirements create "Concurrent Users" "System must support 1000 concurrent users" performance

# Security Requirements
tars requirements create "Data Encryption" "All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit" security

tars requirements create "Authentication" "Multi-factor authentication required for admin accounts" security

# Usability Requirements
tars requirements create "Mobile Responsive" "Interface must be fully functional on mobile devices" usability

tars requirements create "Accessibility" "System must meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards" usability
```

#### Step 3: List and Filter Requirements
```bash
# List all requirements
tars requirements list

# Filter by type
tars requirements list --type functional
tars requirements list --type security

# Filter by status
tars requirements list --status draft
```

#### Step 4: Validate Requirements
```bash
# Validate specific requirements
tars requirements validate REQ-001
tars requirements validate REQ-002
```

#### Step 5: View Comprehensive Statistics
```bash
tars requirements stats
```

### Expected Demo Output

#### Requirements Listing
```
📋 Found 10 requirements:

  📝 REQ-001: User Registration
     Type: Functional | Priority: Medium | Status: Draft

### Advanced Features Demonstration

#### Test Case Creation and Execution
```bash
# Create test cases for requirements
tars requirements test create REQ-001 "Registration Test" "
// F# test code for user registration
let testUserRegistration() =
    let user = { Email = 'test@example.com'; Password = 'SecurePass123!' }
    let result = registerUser user
    result.IsSuccess && result.UserId.IsSome
"

# Run specific test
tars requirements test run TEST-001

# Run all tests for a requirement
tars requirements test run-all --req-id REQ-001
```

#### Traceability Analysis
```bash
# Create traceability links
tars requirements trace create REQ-001 "UserService.fs" "RegisterUser"

# Analyze requirement traceability
tars requirements trace analyze REQ-001
```

#### Regression Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive regression tests
tars requirements regression run
```

### Real Implementation Highlights

#### Type Safety Example
```fsharp
type RequirementType = 
    | Functional | NonFunctional | Performance | Security 
    | Usability | Reliability | Scalability | Maintainability

type Requirement = {
    Id: string
    Title: string
    Description: string
    Type: RequirementType
    Priority: RequirementPriority
    Status: RequirementStatus
    AcceptanceCriteria: string list
    // ... 15+ more fields
}
```

#### Repository Operations
```fsharp
// Real async operations with Result types
member this.CreateRequirementAsync(requirement: Requirement) = task {
    try
        // Real SQLite database operations
        let sql = "INSERT INTO Requirements (...) VALUES (...)"
        let! result = executeWithConnection (fun connection -> ...)
        return Ok requirement.Id
    with
    | ex -> return Error $"Failed to create requirement: {ex.Message}"
}
```

#### Validation Engine
```fsharp
let builtInRules = [
    { Name = "TitleRequired"; Validator = fun req -> ... }
    { Name = "DescriptionRequired"; Validator = fun req -> ... }
    { Name = "AcceptanceCriteriaRequired"; Validator = fun req -> ... }
    // ... 10+ more validation rules
]
```
