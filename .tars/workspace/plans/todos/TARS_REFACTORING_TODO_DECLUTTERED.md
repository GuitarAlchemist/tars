### 2.6. Current Build Issues
The build is still failing with some type conflicts. The main issues are:

1. ✅ Fixed: Ambiguous references between types in TarsEngine.Models.Core and TarsEngine.Models:
   - ✅ Fixed: 'MetricType' is an ambiguous reference between 'TarsEngine.Models.MetricType' and 'TarsEngine.Models.Metrics.MetricType'
   - ✅ Fixed: 'CodeMetric' is an ambiguous reference between 'TarsEngine.Models.CodeMetric' and 'TarsEngine.Models.Metrics.CodeMetric'
2. ✅ Fixed: Interface implementation mismatches:
   - ✅ Fixed: 'FSharpAnalyzer' does not implement interface member 'ILanguageAnalyzer.GetLanguageSpecificMetricTypesAsync()'
3. ✅ Created: Global type aliases solution:
   - ✅ Created: 'TypeAliases.cs' in TarsEngine.Models.Unified namespace with all necessary type aliases
   - ✅ Created: 'GlobalAliases.cs' in TarsEngine namespace with comprehensive type aliases
4. Missing Result<> type in various services
