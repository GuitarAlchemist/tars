6. Fixed the circular dependencies between TarsEngine.Models.Core and TarsEngine.Models
7. Removed the duplicate model classes we created in TarsEngine.Models
8. Fixed the target framework inconsistencies (updated projects to target net9.0)
9. Fixed the package downgrade warnings (updated Microsoft.Extensions.* packages to version 9.0.4)
10. Fixed TarsEngine.Intelligence project by adding missing IntelligenceProgressionSystem class
11. Added missing methods to IntelligenceProgressionSystem class

   - âœ… Added reference from TarsEngine.Models to TarsEngine.Models.Core
   - âœ… Created ModelAliases.cs in TarsEngine.Models to document the relationship
   - âœ… No need for explicit aliases since the types are in the same namespace
6. âœ… Add missing project references to TarsEngine.Utilities and TarsEngine.Extensions
   - âœ… Added references to TarsEngine.CodeAnalysis
   - âœ… Verified that TarsEngine.Services already has the references
