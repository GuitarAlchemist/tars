## Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: Breaking changes during migration
  - **Mitigation**: Implement changes incrementally and ensure each step builds successfully

- **Risk**: Missing dependencies between projects
  - **Mitigation**: Carefully analyze dependencies before moving code

- **Risk**: Circular dependencies
  - **Mitigation**: Establish clear layering and use interfaces to break cycles

- **Risk**: Increased complexity in project structure
  - **Mitigation**: Document project structure and responsibilities clearly

## Timeline

- Phase 1: 1 day
- Phase 2: 1-2 days
- Phase 3: 1-2 days
- Phase 4: 1-2 days
- Phase 5: 1 day

Total estimated time: 5-8 days

## Success Criteria

- All projects build successfully
- All tests pass
- Build times are reduced
- Code is more maintainable and easier to understand
- Clear separation of concerns between projects
