# TARS Auto-Implementation TODOs

## Current Status
- F# Tree-of-Thought implementation has compilation errors
- C# implementation of Tree-of-Thought works but is limited
- Metascript integration is incomplete
- Code analysis and transformation capabilities need enhancement

## High Priority Tasks

### 1. Fix F# Integration Issues
- [ ] Resolve type mismatches in `MetascriptToT.fs` and `MetascriptGeneration.fs`
- [ ] Fix the `ThoughtNode` vs `MetascriptThoughtNode` type conflicts
- [ ] Update the F# project structure to better integrate with C# components
- [ ] Create proper interoperability layer between F# and C# code

### 2. Enhance Tree-of-Thought Implementation
- [x] Create basic Tree-of-Thought implementation in C#
- [x] Implement pattern detection for code analysis
- [x] Create code transformation capabilities
- [ ] Implement beam search for exploring multiple solution paths
- [ ] Add support for learning from previous transformations
- [ ] Create visualization tools for the thought tree

### 3. Improve Code Analysis
- [x] Implement basic code analyzer using Roslyn
- [x] Create pattern detector for identifying common patterns
- [ ] Add semantic analysis to understand code meaning and intent
- [ ] Implement data flow analysis for more accurate insights
- [ ] Add support for analyzing different programming languages
- [ ] Create a unified analysis report format

### 4. Enhance Code Transformation
- [x] Create basic code transformer for applying targeted fixes
- [ ] Implement AST manipulation for precise code changes
- [ ] Add support for different transformation strategies
- [ ] Implement transformation validation to ensure correctness
- [ ] Create a feedback loop for learning from successful transformations

### 5. Metascript Integration
- [x] Create basic metascripts for Tree-of-Thought reasoning
- [ ] Update metascripts to use enhanced code analysis
- [ ] Create metascripts for different transformation types
- [ ] Implement metascript generation based on analysis results
- [ ] Add support for metascript composition

## Medium Priority Tasks

### 1. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Create test generation for transformed code
- [ ] Implement regression testing to ensure functionality
- [ ] Add validation for security and performance
- [ ] Create a feedback loop for continuous improvement

### 2. User Interface and Documentation
- [ ] Enhance CLI interface with more options
- [ ] Create detailed documentation for each component
- [ ] Add examples for common use cases
- [ ] Create tutorials for extending the system

### 3. Integration with External Tools
- [ ] Add integration with code quality tools
- [ ] Implement integration with version control systems
- [ ] Create plugins for popular IDEs
- [ ] Add support for CI/CD pipelines

## Low Priority Tasks

### 1. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize code analysis for large codebases
- [ ] Implement caching for repeated analyses
- [ ] Add parallel processing for multiple files
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for large projects

### 2. Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement multi-language support
- [ ] Add support for cross-file analysis and transformation
- [ ] Create domain-specific language for defining transformations
- [ ] Implement machine learning for pattern recognition

## Next Steps for TARS Auto-Implementation

1. **Create a C# Implementation of Tree-of-Thought**: Since the F# implementation has compilation errors, create a C# implementation that can be used immediately.

2. **Enhance Code Analysis**: Improve the code analyzer to detect more issues and provide more detailed analysis.

3. **Improve Code Transformation**: Enhance the code transformation to handle more complex code changes.

4. **Create a Feedback Loop**: Implement a feedback loop to learn from successful and unsuccessful improvements.

5. **Integrate with Existing TARS Components**: Integrate the Tree-of-Thought implementation with existing TARS components like the metascript engine and code analysis services.
