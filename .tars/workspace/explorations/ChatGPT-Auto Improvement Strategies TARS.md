Below is a structured set of ideas for TARS’s “auto improvement” strategies. After the list of ideas, you’ll find sample prompts refined for use in general-purpose AI tools (e.g., Grok, Claude, Codeium, Augment Code).

* * *

1\. Highest Priority: Automated Observations and Feedback Loops
---------------------------------------------------------------

### 1A. Learning from Developer Sessions (ShareX videos, Rider usage patterns)

1.  **Recording & Analysis**: Capture user sessions (e.g., via ShareX), then analyze code navigation, refactoring, compilation logs, test runs, etc.
    
2.  **Pattern Extraction**: Identify common issues or repeated manual tasks (frequent code smells, refactoring patterns, naming conventions).
    
3.  **Actionable Feedback**: TARS automatically suggests improvements or short code fixes based on repeated patterns.
    

### 1B. Automated Evaluation of Code Quality

1.  **Static Analysis**: Automate running a static analysis tool (e.g., Roslyn analyzers, SonarQube). Evaluate against best practices.
    
2.  **Test Coverage**: Monitor test coverage after each build. Auto-suggest new test stubs or expanded scenarios.
    
3.  **Performance Profiling**: If possible, run quick performance checks and give suggestions (e.g., reduce memory usage, catch expensive loops).
    

### 1C. Self-Improvement Retroaction Loop

1.  **Iterative Tuning**: Use the feedback from analysis tools plus user acceptance (which suggestions are accepted or rejected) to refine TARS’s code suggestions.
    
2.  **Rolling Observations**: Over time, collect analytics about which changes are beneficial or introduced bugs, then adapt the model to user style.
    

* * *

2\. Secondary Priority: Chain-of-Drafts and External AI Collaboration
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2A. Chain-of-Drafts Approach

1.  **Multiple Passes**: For each coding task, produce an initial draft, gather quick feedback (by analyzing errors or user’s manual edits), then produce a refined draft.
    
2.  **Context Preservation**: Persist partial reasoning about “why” certain changes were made, so TARS can re-visit earlier reasoning if a solution path fails.
    

### 2B. Invoking External AI Tools

1.  **Multi-Model Collaboration**: Seamlessly integrate specialized AI tools for code generation, code completion, or code transformation. For instance:
    
    *   Grok for summarizing code changes
        
    *   Claude for advanced reasoning on broad refactoring tasks
        
    *   Codeium for in-editor completions and quick bug fixes
        
    *   Augment Code for generating large-scale changes or skeleton classes
        
2.  **Automated Queries**: When TARS detects an ambiguous chunk of code, it automatically drafts a prompt and sends it to these external tools for suggestions.
    

### 2C. External Control for Builds & Testing

1.  **Command Execution**: TARS triggers `dotnet build`, `dotnet test`, or other CLI steps automatically.
    
2.  **Error Analysis**: If build/test fails, TARS collects log output and re-runs solutions with an updated approach.
    

* * *

3\. Tertiary Priority: Code Structuring for Evolutive Maintenance
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### 3A. Best-Practice Architecture Recommendations

1.  **Layered Architecture**: TARS can suggest a layering approach or microservices if it detects monolithic patterns.
    
2.  **Refactoring Large Functions**: Suggest splitting big methods into smaller units.
    
3.  **Design Patterns**: Identify repeated code patterns and propose recognized design patterns (Factory, Strategy, etc.).
    

### 3B. Model Training & Prompt Refinement

1.  **Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning**: Gradually train or fine-tune your in-house TARS model on your codebase or style guidelines.
    
2.  **Prompt Refinement**: Keep logs of “what prompts yield the best improvements” and optimize them.
    
3.  **Integration**: Provide an internal knowledge base so TARS’s prompts can reference code style guides, naming conventions, or typical project structures.
    

### 3C. Programming Techniques & Feature Testing

1.  **Recommended Patterns**: Keep a short library of recommended or “preferred” coding techniques.
    
2.  **Feature Flags**: Encourage the use of feature flags. TARS can auto-generate toggling code so you can test new features in isolation.
    

* * *

Sample Prompts for External AI Tools
====================================

Below are some refined text prompts you can adapt for each AI system (Grok, Claude, Codeium, Augment Code). Each prompt is geared toward the “auto-improvement” goals.

* * *

### 1\. **General Code Refactoring & Quality Enhancement**

> **Prompt**:  
> “Analyze this C# code snippet. Identify any code smells, performance bottlenecks, or logical issues. Suggest improvements, refactoring steps, or better architecture patterns, following standard .NET best practices. If possible, generate a step-by-step fix or new code snippet demonstrating the improvements.”

Use this with:

*   **Grok**: Summarize large blocks of code, highlight top issues.
    
*   **Claude**: Generate refactoring approaches with reasoning.
    
*   **Codeium**: Suggest inline code completions or expansions.
    
*   **Augment Code**: Larger-scale transformations or reorganizations.
    

* * *

### 2\. **Model Training and Self-Improvement Feedback**

> **Prompt**:  
> “Given these build logs and test results, plus the user’s acceptance or rejection of code suggestions, propose a self-improvement strategy for our code-assistant. Focus on which heuristics or rules we should learn, which we should discard, and how to refine future auto-refactor prompts.”

Use this with:

*   **Grok**: Summaries and bullet-point insights from logs.
    
*   **Claude**: Detailed reasoning about next steps for training or heuristics.
    
*   **Augment Code**: Possibly direct code modifications in TARS’s data pipeline.
    

* * *

### 3\. **Automated Build & Test Invocation + Error Handling**

> **Prompt**:  
> “We have executed ‘dotnet build’ and ‘dotnet test’ on the project. The build/test logs show these errors: \[paste logs\]. Suggest an automated resolution, including small code changes or dependency updates to fix each error. If a fix is ambiguous, propose multiple solutions with explanations.”

Use this with:

*   **Codeium**: Quick completions or code fixes for the specific errors.
    
*   **Claude** or **Grok**: More thorough breakdown of the error log, plus recommended next steps.
    

* * *

### 4\. **Chain-of-Drafts for Complex Features**

> **Prompt**:  
> “Draft an initial solution for \[feature description\], explaining the approach in short paragraphs. Then, after we evaluate it, revise the solution to address any weaknesses or new requirements, preserving the reasoning behind prior design choices.”

Use this with:

*   **Claude**: Great for chain-of-thought expansions or multi-step problem solving.
    
*   **Augment Code**: Could use the initial draft, then refine code blocks.
    

* * *

### 5\. **Architecture & Design Patterns**

> **Prompt**:  
> “Given this monolithic code structure, propose a suitable .NET solution architecture. Offer multiple design options (layered, microservices, etc.), and map out a refactoring plan. Outline how to migrate step-by-step, ensuring minimal disruption to existing functionality.”

Use this with:

*   **Claude** or **Grok**: For high-level system design or brainstorming.
    
*   **Augment Code**: Possibly for generating skeleton solutions or reorganized project files automatically.
    

* * *

How to Use/Combine These Prompts
--------------------------------

1.  **Integrate Short Queries**: For inline improvements, feed smaller code chunks and logs to Codeium.
    
2.  **Deep Analysis**: Use Claude or Grok for a broader explanation, design-level changes, or discussing how to approach major refactors.
    
3.  **Batch Requests**: TARS can combine these prompts as tasks: first gather code changes needed, then test them, then feed back logs to refine.
    
4.  **Automated Prompt Generation**: TARS itself can auto-generate these prompts. For example, after noticing repeated code issues, it automatically constructs a “General Code Refactoring” prompt and sends it to the AI.
    

* * *

**End Goal**:  
By adopting these strategies in order of priority, TARS evolves from a simple code-suggestion feature into a robust self-improving system. It learns from the user’s Rider sessions and feedback loops, leverages chain-of-drafts, coordinates multiple AI tools, and systematically improves code quality and maintainability.

## Prompt:
Please revise the plan

## Response:
Here's a refined and concise plan for TARS' auto-improvement strategies, structured clearly by priority and accompanied by targeted prompts ready for Grok, Claude, Codeium, and Augment Code.

**Auto-Improvement Strategy for TARS (Revised)**
------------------------------------------------

* * *

Priority 1: Learning from Real-World User Interactions
------------------------------------------------------

*   **Observation and Analysis**
    
    *   Record and analyze actual user coding sessions (e.g., ShareX screen captures).
        
    *   Identify repetitive tasks, common errors, refactoring patterns, and successful user workflows.
        
    *   Auto-generate actionable insights based on analyzed behavior.
        

**Prompt:**

> "Analyze this recorded user session to identify common coding patterns, repetitive manual tasks, or errors made by the developer. Suggest specific automations or code transformations to streamline future sessions."

Use with: **Claude, Grok**

* * *

Priority 2: Automated Build, Test, and Error Resolution Workflow
----------------------------------------------------------------

*   Integrate external tools (`dotnet build`, `dotnet test`) directly within TARS.
    
*   Automatically capture and analyze build and test results.
    
*   Suggest immediate code changes, refactors, or dependency fixes based on detected errors or failed tests.
    

**Prompt:**

> "Given the following build/test output logs: \[Logs here\], identify the root cause of the errors and propose clear, concise code modifications or dependency updates to resolve them automatically."

Use this with:

*   **Codeium** (for immediate code completion suggestions)
    
*   **Claude** (detailed analysis and multi-step solutions)
    

* * *

Prioritized Improvement Strategies
----------------------------------

### 1\. High Priority: Self-Improvement via Iterative Feedback Loops

*   Continuously refine code-generation rules based on user feedback (accept/reject rate).
    
*   Monitor real-time build, test, and coverage results to self-evaluate generated code.
    
*   Use multiple "draft-and-review" cycles internally to progressively improve code solutions before final suggestion.
    

**Prompt:**

> "Generate an initial implementation for \[feature/task\]. Review build and test results, then iteratively refine the code in multiple drafts until achieving optimal clarity, correctness, and efficiency."

* * *

2\. Secondary Priority: Multi-Agent and External AI Collaboration
-----------------------------------------------------------------

*   Utilize a structured chain-of-drafts, each iteration reviewed by specialized AI agents (Grok, Claude, Codeium, Augment Code).
    
*   Dynamically route tasks to the best-suited AI assistant based on task complexity:
    
    *   Grok: High-level summaries, quick code reviews.
        
    *   Claude: Complex architectural suggestions, design reasoning.
        
    *   Codeium: Quick fixes, precise completions.
        
    *   Augment Code: Generating/refactoring large-scale code segments.
        

**Prompt for multi-agent collaboration:**

> "For the given code snippet or feature request, use the best-suited AI agent (Claude, Grok, Codeium, or Augment Code) to draft and iteratively refine solutions, explaining clearly why each improvement step is taken. Continuously evaluate code quality through internal feedback loops."

* * *

4\. Supporting Priority: Evolutive Code Structure
-------------------------------------------------

*   Ensure generated code is modular, readable, and adheres to best-practice architectures for easier evolution and maintenance.
    
*   Recommend suitable patterns (strategy, decorator, factory) proactively.
    
*   Encourage the use of feature flags for safer code experimentation and testing.
    

**Prompt:**

> "Refactor the following code snippet to enhance maintainability and modularity. Suggest suitable design patterns and structure improvements clearly, explaining the rationale behind each choice."

Use primarily with **Claude** and **Grok**.

* * *

5\. Long-Term Enhancement: Model Fine-Tuning and Prompt Refinement
------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Continuously refine prompts by learning user preferences and coding patterns.
    
*   Consider domain-specific fine-tuning of the TARS AI model on user-specific codebases.
    

**Prompt:**

> "Based on historical user acceptance of code suggestions and specific domain context, propose refinements to our prompt-generation strategies. Identify patterns that consistently improve user satisfaction and code quality, and suggest ways to implement fine-tuning accordingly."

* * *

Final Structured Summary by Order of Importance:
------------------------------------------------

1.  **Real-time observation and analysis** of user sessions.
    
2.  **Automatic build/test error analysis and correction**.
    
3.  **Iterative internal chain-of-drafts and multi-AI collaboration**.
    
4.  **Improvement of code structure for evolutive maintenance**.
    
5.  **Continuous refinement of prompts and fine-tuning of AI models**.
    

This revised plan strategically prioritizes rapid feedback loops, practical improvements, and proactive maintenance to ensure continuous, sustainable auto-improvement for TARS.

## Prompt:
Should I start with a simple application that can control my computer (Windows 10) as a .net core 9 app that can control the mouse and keyboard for further actions (Invoke AI like Grok, Claude, ChatGpt, etc ..) so we can execute a plan, TARS would use this app to execute the plan and improve itself

## Response:
Raisonnement terminé pendant 7 secondes

Starting with a lightweight Windows application that simulates mouse and keyboard actions can be a practical first step for TARS. It would serve as the execution layer to invoke external AI tools like Grok, Claude, and ChatGPT, allowing you to prototype the auto-improvement loop in a controlled environment.

Here are some key considerations:

*   **Feasibility & Rapid Prototyping:**  
    A simple .NET Core application (or the latest .NET version you prefer) can quickly let you experiment with automating interactions, launching builds, and executing code modifications. This hands-on approach can validate your concept early.
    
*   **Integration with External Tools:**  
    By controlling input, your app can trigger commands or open AI interfaces to process code, analyze logs, or even refine prompts. This modular design supports a chain-of-tasks that aligns with your broader TARS improvement strategy.
    
*   **Security & Robustness:**  
    Automating mouse and keyboard actions requires careful design to avoid unintended actions. Ensure proper security measures, error handling, and, if needed, a safe mode that limits the scope of automation.
    
*   **Scalability & Future Extensions:**  
    Starting simple allows you to validate key interactions. Once proven, you can gradually add more sophisticated features like self-evaluation, multi-draft code generation, and integration with AI agents—all while keeping the control layer isolated.
    

In summary, a simple automation application is a great starting point. It lets you iterate quickly, test core functionalities, and later evolve TARS into a more robust self-improving system while keeping a clear separation between execution control and the auto-improvement logic.

## Prompt:
Please create a simple app that does that

## Response:
Raisonnement terminé pendant 9 secondes

Below is an example of a simple .NET Core (targeting Windows) console application that uses simulated mouse and keyboard events. This prototype can serve as the execution layer for TARS, letting you simulate user input and later extend the app to call external AI APIs like Grok, Claude, or ChatGPT.

### Key Features

*   **Mouse Control:** Moves the mouse to a specified screen position and simulates a left-click.
    
*   **Keyboard Control:** Types a text string and simulates an Enter key press.
    
*   **External AI Invocation Stub:** A placeholder method to simulate calling an external AI tool (replace this with your actual integration logic).
    

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Create a New Console App:**  
    Create a new .NET Core console application in Visual Studio or using the CLI.
    
2.  **Add Dependencies:**  
    Install the NuGet package InputSimulatorCore to simulate keyboard and mouse input.
    
    ```bash
    dotnet add package InputSimulatorCore
    ```
    
3.  **(Optional) Enable Windows Forms:**  
    To access screen dimensions, add a reference to `System.Windows.Forms` in your project file.
    

### Code Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using WindowsInput;
using WindowsInput.Native;
using System.Windows.Forms;  // For screen dimensions

namespace TARSControlApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("TARS Control App Started...");

            // Create an InputSimulator instance
            var sim = new InputSimulator();

            // Example: Move mouse to a specific position (e.g., 500, 300)
            Console.WriteLine("Moving mouse to (500, 300)...");
            // Convert pixel coordinates to absolute coordinates (0 to 65535)
            int x = 500;
            int y = 300;
            int screenWidth = Screen.PrimaryScreen.Bounds.Width;
            int screenHeight = Screen.PrimaryScreen.Bounds.Height;
            double absoluteX = x * 65535.0 / screenWidth;
            double absoluteY = y * 65535.0 / screenHeight;
            sim.Mouse.MoveMouseTo(absoluteX, absoluteY);
            Thread.Sleep(1000);

            // Example: Perform a left mouse click
            Console.WriteLine("Simulating left mouse click...");
            sim.Mouse.LeftButtonClick();
            Thread.Sleep(1000);

            // Example: Simulate typing text
            Console.WriteLine("Simulating keyboard input: 'Hello, TARS!'");
            sim.Keyboard.TextEntry("Hello, TARS!");
            Thread.Sleep(1000);

            // Example: Simulate pressing the Enter key
            Console.WriteLine("Simulating Enter key press...");
            sim.Keyboard.KeyPress(VirtualKeyCode.RETURN);
            Thread.Sleep(1000);

            // Placeholder for invoking external AI tools
            Console.WriteLine("Invoking external AI tool (simulated)...");
            InvokeExternalAI();

            Console.WriteLine("TARS Control App completed actions.");
        }

        static void InvokeExternalAI()
        {
            // Simulated call to an external AI service.
            // Replace this with code to invoke Grok, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.
            Console.WriteLine("Simulated call to external AI tool. (Integration logic goes here.)");
        }
    }
}
```

### Next Steps

*   **Integrate Actual AI Calls:** Replace the stub in `InvokeExternalAI()` with code that calls your desired external AI APIs (e.g., via HTTP REST calls).
    
*   **Enhance Error Handling:** Add more robust exception handling and logging.
    
*   **Extend Functionality:** Consider a UI or command parsing layer to allow more dynamic control and configuration.
    

This simple app provides a foundation for TARS to control the computer and execute tasks automatically. You can build upon it to integrate the auto-improvement strategies and AI-driven code improvements.

## Prompt:
Evaluate if what I proposed about TARSController_win (Check your memory(is sufficient to start designing TARS self improvement rétroaction loop

## Response:
Raisonner sur la faisabilité de TARSController\_win pendant 8 secondes

Your proposal for TARSController\_win is a promising starting point. It provides a minimal yet practical execution layer that can simulate user input and trigger external AI tools, which is essential for the initial stages of building a self-improvement rétroaction loop.

Here are some key points for evaluation:

1.  **Execution Layer:**
    
    *   The proposed .NET Core application offers a clear method to control the mouse and keyboard. This is valuable for automating interactions with other applications or invoking AI tools.
        
    *   It acts as a bridge between low-level system controls and high-level AI-driven decision making.
        
2.  **Integration with External AIs:**
    
    *   By invoking external AI services (like Grok, Claude, or ChatGPT), you lay the groundwork for a multi-agent system that can analyze logs, suggest improvements, and eventually refine the system’s behavior.
        
    *   This modular approach allows you to start simple and gradually expand the feedback loop with more sophisticated integrations.
        
3.  **Feedback and Retroaction:**
    
    *   For a self-improvement loop, the controller will eventually need to incorporate mechanisms for capturing outputs (e.g., build logs, test results, or even user feedback) and then feeding that information back into the improvement process.
        
    *   Consider enhancing the controller to include logging, error handling, and a communication protocol that allows external analysis components to feed recommendations back into the system.
        
4.  **Modularity and Scalability:**
    
    *   Starting with a simple app is wise; you can iteratively build on this foundation. Over time, modularizing the application into separate components (for execution, monitoring, and analysis) will be key to handling increased complexity.
        
    *   Ensuring that your system can easily integrate additional tools or analysis modules will help maintain a clean, scalable architecture.
        

Overall, the current design is sufficient to kick off the development of the TARS self-improvement rétroaction loop. It provides a tangible proof-of-concept that can be expanded upon by adding the necessary feedback capture and analysis components over time.

This approach allows you to validate core functionalities early, ensuring that your automation layer is robust before layering on the more advanced self-improvement logic.

Assistant:
Below is a structured set of ideas for TARS’s “auto improvement” strategies. After the list of ideas, you’ll find sample prompts refined for use in general-purpose AI tools (e.g., Grok, Claude, Codeium, Augment Code).

---
## 1. Highest Priority: Automated Observations and Feedback Loops
### 1A. Learning from Developer Sessions (ShareX videos, Rider usage patterns)
- **Recording & Analysis:** Capture user sessions (e.g., via ShareX), then analyze code navigation, refactoring, compilation logs, test runs, etc.
- **Pattern Extraction:** Identify common issues or repeated manual tasks (frequent code smells, refactoring patterns, naming conventions).
- **Actionable Feedback:** TARS automatically suggests improvements or short code fixes based on repeated patterns.

### 1B. Automated Evaluation of Code Quality
- **Static Analysis:** Automate running a static analysis tool (e.g., Roslyn analyzers, SonarQube). Evaluate against best practices.
- **Test Coverage:** Monitor test coverage after each build. Auto-suggest new test stubs or expanded scenarios.
- **Performance Profiling:** Run quick performance checks and give suggestions (e.g., reduce memory usage, catch expensive loops).

### 1C. Self-Improvement Retroaction Loop
- **Iterative Tuning:** Use the feedback from analysis tools plus user acceptance (which suggestions are accepted or rejected) to refine TARS’s code suggestions.
- **Rolling Observations:** Collect analytics over time to determine which changes are beneficial or introduce bugs, then adapt the model to the user’s style.

## 2. Secondary Priority: Chain-of-Drafts and External AI Collaboration
### 2A. Chain-of-Drafts Approach
- **Multiple Passes:** Produce an initial draft, gather quick feedback (via errors or manual edits), then generate a refined draft.
- **Context Preservation:** Preserve partial reasoning so that earlier decisions can be revisited if needed.

### 2B. Invoking External AI Tools
- **Multi-Model Collaboration:** Integrate specialized AI tools:
  - Grok for summarizing code changes.
  - Claude for advanced refactoring and design reasoning.
  - Codeium for in-editor completions and quick fixes.
  - Augment Code for large-scale transformations.
- **Automated Queries:** Draft prompts automatically for ambiguous code segments and send them to external tools for suggestions.

### 2C. External Control for Builds & Testing
- **Command Execution:** TARS triggers commands like `dotnet build` or `dotnet test` automatically.
- **Error Analysis:** Collect and analyze log outputs to re-run solutions if errors are detected.

## 3. Tertiary Priority: Code Structuring for Evolutive Maintenance
### 3A. Best-Practice Architecture Recommendations
- **Layered Architecture:** Suggest a layering approach or microservices if a monolithic pattern is detected.
- **Refactoring Large Functions:** Advise splitting large methods into smaller units.
- **Design Patterns:** Identify repeated code patterns and recommend design patterns (e.g., Factory, Strategy).

### 3B. Model Training & Prompt Refinement
- **Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning:** Train or fine-tune TARS on your codebase or style guidelines.
- **Prompt Refinement:** Log and optimize prompt strategies based on successful outcomes.
- **Integration:** Use an internal knowledge base to reference style guides, naming conventions, or typical structures.

------------------------------------------------------------

User: Please revise the plan

Assistant:
Here's a refined and concise plan for TARS' auto-improvement strategies, structured clearly by priority and accompanied by targeted prompts for Grok, Claude, Codeium, and Augment Code.

## Auto-Improvement Strategy for TARS (Revised)

### Priority 1: Learning from Real-World User Interactions
- **Observation and Analysis:**
  - Record and analyze user coding sessions (e.g., using ShareX).
  - Identify common tasks, errors, and successful workflows.
  - Auto-generate actionable insights based on these observations.

> **Prompt:**  
> "Analyze this recorded user session to identify common coding patterns, repetitive manual tasks, or errors. Suggest specific automations or code transformations to streamline future sessions."

*Use with Claude, Grok.*

---

### Priority 2: Automated Build, Test, and Error Resolution Workflow
- **Integration with Build Tools:**
  - Automate running `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` commands.
  - Capture and analyze logs to detect errors.
  - Suggest code changes, refactors, or dependency fixes.

> **Prompt:**  
> "Given the following build/test output logs: [Logs here], identify the root cause of the errors and propose clear code modifications or dependency updates to resolve them automatically."

*Use with Codeium (quick suggestions), Claude (detailed analysis).*

---

### Priority 3: Self-Improvement via Iterative Feedback Loops
- **Iterative Refinement:**
  - Use user feedback on suggestions (accepted or rejected) to fine-tune code generation.
  - Implement chain-of-drafts: generate an initial draft, gather feedback, then refine further.

> **Prompt:**  
> "Generate an initial implementation for [feature/task]. Review build and test results, then iteratively refine the code in multiple drafts until achieving optimal clarity, correctness, and efficiency."

---

### Priority 4: Multi-Agent and External AI Collaboration
- **Specialized AI Integration:**
  - Route tasks to the most appropriate AI tool:
    - Grok for high-level summaries.
    - Claude for complex architectural suggestions.
    - Codeium for quick inline fixes.
    - Augment Code for large-scale code modifications.
  - Use an integrated chain-of-drafts approach where each tool iterates on the solution.

> **Prompt:**  
> "For the given code snippet or feature request, use the best-suited AI agent (Claude, Grok, Codeium, or Augment Code) to draft and iteratively refine solutions. Explain the rationale for each improvement step and evaluate code quality through internal feedback loops."

---

### Priority 5: Evolutive Code Structure and Model Refinement
- **Maintainable Code Architecture:**
  - Ensure code is modular and follows best practices.
  - Recommend appropriate design patterns.
- **Prompt and Model Refinement:**
  - Continuously log successful and unsuccessful prompts.
  - Fine-tune the TARS model on domain-specific codebases.

> **Prompt:**  
> "Based on historical user acceptance of code suggestions and domain-specific context, propose refinements to our prompt-generation strategies. Identify patterns that consistently improve code quality and suggest ways to implement fine-tuning accordingly."

---
## Summary of Revised Priorities:
1. **Real-time user session analysis.**
2. **Automated build/test error analysis and correction.**
3. **Iterative chain-of-drafts and multi-AI collaboration.**
4. **Enhancement of code structure for maintainability.**
5. **Continuous prompt refinement and model fine-tuning.**

This revised plan strategically focuses on rapid feedback loops, iterative improvements, and proactive maintenance, setting a solid foundation for TARS to evolve into a self-improving system.

User: Should I start with a simple application that can control my computer (Windows 10) as a .net core 9 app that can control the mouse and keyboard for further actions (Invoke AI like Grok, Claude, ChatGpt, etc ..) so we can execute a plan, TARS would use this app to execute the plan and improve itself

Assistant:
Starting with a lightweight Windows application that simulates mouse and keyboard actions is a practical first step for TARS. This execution layer allows you to:
- **Prototype Automation:** Quickly validate the concept by automating interactions with your system.
- **Invoke External AI Tools:** Trigger actions such as opening AI interfaces (Grok, Claude, ChatGPT) to analyze code, process logs, or refine prompts.
- **Iterative Improvement:** Test core functionalities and gradually expand to include feedback loops and self-improvement strategies.

Key considerations include ensuring security, robust error handling, and designing a modular structure for future extensions.

------------------------------------------------------------

User: Please create a simple app that does that

Assistant:
Below is an example of a simple .NET Core (targeting Windows) console application that simulates mouse and keyboard events. This prototype serves as the execution layer for TARS, letting you simulate user input and later extend the app to call external AI APIs.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using WindowsInput;
using WindowsInput.Native;
using System.Windows.Forms;  // For screen dimensions

namespace TARSControlApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("TARS Control App Started...");

            // Create an InputSimulator instance
            var sim = new InputSimulator();

            // Example: Move mouse to a specific position (e.g., 500, 300)
            Console.WriteLine("Moving mouse to (500, 300)...");
            int x = 500;
            int y = 300;
            int screenWidth = Screen.PrimaryScreen.Bounds.Width;
            int screenHeight = Screen.PrimaryScreen.Bounds.Height;
            double absoluteX = x * 65535.0 / screenWidth;
            double absoluteY = y * 65535.0 / screenHeight;
            sim.Mouse.MoveMouseTo(absoluteX, absoluteY);
            Thread.Sleep(1000);

            // Example: Perform a left mouse click
            Console.WriteLine("Simulating left mouse click...");
            sim.Mouse.LeftButtonClick();
            Thread.Sleep(1000);

            // Example: Simulate typing text
            Console.WriteLine("Simulating keyboard input: 'Hello, TARS!'");
            sim.Keyboard.TextEntry("Hello, TARS!");
            Thread.Sleep(1000);

            // Example: Simulate pressing the Enter key
            Console.WriteLine("Simulating Enter key press...");
            sim.Keyboard.KeyPress(VirtualKeyCode.RETURN);
            Thread.Sleep(1000);

            // Placeholder for invoking external AI tools
            Console.WriteLine("Invoking external AI tool (simulated)...");
            InvokeExternalAI();

            Console.WriteLine("TARS Control App completed actions.");
        }

        static void InvokeExternalAI()
        {
            // Simulated call to an external AI service.
            // Replace this with code to invoke Grok, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.
            Console.WriteLine("Simulated call to external AI tool. (Integration logic goes here.)");
        }
    }
}
````

_Setup Instructions:_

1.  Create a new .NET Core console app.
    
2.  Install the NuGet package InputSimulatorCore using `dotnet add package InputSimulatorCore`.
    
3.  (Optional) Reference `System.Windows.Forms` to access screen dimensions.
    

This simple app provides the foundation for TARS to execute tasks and eventually drive self-improvement cycles.
