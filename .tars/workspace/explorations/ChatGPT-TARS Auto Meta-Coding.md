## Prompt:
For my tars project, do you think it's realistic to have tars auto code it's own metascripts from existing metascripts?

## Response:
Réflexion durant 5 secondes

**Short answer** – Yes, it’s realistic, but only if you treat “auto-coding a new .metatars” as a _controlled compiler pipeline_ instead of a one-shot LLM prompt.  
Below is a feasibility breakdown, the architectural pieces you still need, and some concrete next steps that fit the design choices you’ve already made for TARS.

* * *

1 · What “realistic” really means here
--------------------------------------

| Dimension | Reality-check | Why it’s Achievable for TARS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Syntax** | Your `.tars` DSL is YAML-ish and already has a stable schema ➜ trivial to parse with F# type providers. | The generator can operate on a well-typed AST rather than raw text. |
| **Semantics** | You’ve formalized blocks like `agentic`, `belief_graph`, `reflection`, etc. | This gives you an explicit contract to evaluate new scripts against – a prerequisite for safe self-modification. |
| **Code-gen quality** | LLMs hallucinate; you need deterministic post-processing. | You can post-edit the LLM output with your F# interpreter + Roslyn analyzers to enforce rules automatically. |
| **Safety/rollback** | Bad meta-updates could brick the pipeline. | You already store every version under `output/versions/` and have a rollback requirement. Plug a git worktree or simple SHA-named folder copy into the pipeline. |
| **Validation** | Generated metascript must compile _and_ pass sanity checks (e.g. no orphan agent IDs, belief cycles bounded). | You can reuse your existing schema validator and run a quick headless simulation (`tarscli simulate-agentic --dry-run`) before accepting the new file. |

If you gate each step with machine-checkable tests, “TARS writes TARS” becomes a controlled form of compilation, not sci-fi magic.

2 · Minimal self-metacoding pipeline
------------------------------------

```text
┌──────────┐
│ existing │
│ .tars vN │
└────┬─────┘
     │ parse (F# Type Provider) → AST
     ▼
┌──────────┐
│ Analyzer │  (diff engine, metrics, belief contradictions, runtime stats)
└────┬─────┘
     │ produces “meta-diagnostics”
     ▼
┌──────────┐
│ Planner  │  (LLM + rule-based heuristics)
└────┬─────┘
     │ emits high-level “next-iteration plan”
     ▼
┌──────────┐
│ Synthes. │  (LLM in structured-output mode
│          │   → fills .tars template slots)
└────┬─────┘
     │ post-process / lint / canonicalize YAML
     ▼
┌──────────┐
│  Tester  │  run validator + headless sim
└────┬─────┘
┌────▼─────┐  if fail → feedback into Planner
│  Commit   │  if pass → save as vN+1 and
└───────────┘             run regression suite
```

_LLM usage is confined to Planner & Synthesizer; everything else is deterministic._

3 · Concrete components you still need
--------------------------------------

| Component | Implementation sketch |
| --- | --- |
| **DSL → AST loader** | `YamlDotNet` + an F# type provider so every block is strongly-typed. |
| **Diff & metrics engine** | You already log runtime stats; surface them as JSON and feed them to the Analyzer. |
| **Rule pack** | Start with 3 “hard” rules (no breaking schema change, no duplicate agent IDs, performance metric must not regress > x %). Add more later. |
| **LLM template** | Serve a prompt file like `prompts/next_step.tmpl` that injects (a) diagnostics summary, (b) spec of allowed changes, (c) strict JSON-YAML schema; enforce `json_mode` output in Ollama. |
| **Post-processor** | Tiny F# script: order keys canonically, re-emit flow-style YAML, run schema validator. |
| **Headless simulator** | You already planned `tarscli simulate-agentic`. Make `--dry-run` the default test stage. |

* * *

4 · Typical failure modes & mitigations
---------------------------------------

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| LLM drifts from schema | JSON/YAML schema validation + auto-repair (delete unknown keys). |
| Regressive change sneaks in | Regression suite: diff metric thresholds, belief-graph integrity checks, execution time, etc. |
| Infinite feedback loop | Version cap per session (e.g. max 3 iterations) + manual approval before next batch. |
| Storage bloat | Prune versions older than _n_ or squash minor versions after a major checkpoint. |

* * *

5 · Next sprint checklist (1–2 days of work)
--------------------------------------------

1.  **Finish the F# `TarsDsl.Ast` library** – include parser + pretty-printer.
    
2.  **Wrap your existing schema validator** as a dotnet tool so it can be called by `tarscli`.
    
3.  **Draft `prompts/next_step.tmpl`** and test locally with `ollama run phi3` (or whatever coder model you choose).
    
4.  **Implement `tarscli evolve`** command: glue the pipeline steps together.
    
5.  **Write at least two unit tests**:
    
    *   “No-op change” (LLM instructed to keep everything) must pass.
        
    *   “Introduce forbidden field” must fail validation.
        

Once that works, TARS can _already_ rewrite its own metascripts in a loop – gated by the same engine that will later run in production.

* * *

### Bottom line

Self-metacoding is _absolutely_ within reach because:

*   The DSL is structured and machine-verifiable.
    
*   You already envisioned rollback, metrics, and simulation hooks.
    
*   Local LLMs (DeepSeek-Coder, CodeGemma) are strong enough for controlled YAML synthesis when given explicit templates.
    

Treat the LLM as a **planner/template-filler** and keep every other step deterministic. That’s the recipe that lets TARS safely write TARS.
