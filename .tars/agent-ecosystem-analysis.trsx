## Metascript Reasoning
```yaml
analysis_approach: "Static analysis of agent ecosystem with dynamic interaction modeling"
confidence_factors:
  - "Direct observation of agent behavior and outputs"
  - "Analysis of actual failure patterns and root causes"
  - "Mapping of user expectations vs. system capabilities"
  - "Identification of architectural patterns and anti-patterns"

key_insights:
  - "The core issue is architectural, not implementation"
  - "Agent responsibilities are unclear and overlapping"
  - "Missing critical capabilities create cascade failures"
  - "User expectation management is completely absent"

systemic_nature:
  - "Issues affect entire agent ecosystem, not individual agents"
  - "Root causes are in architecture and process, not code"
  - "Solutions require ecosystem-wide changes, not patches"
  - "Prevention requires proactive design, not reactive fixes"
```

## Execution Trigger
```f#
// Auto-execute when metascript is loaded
let result = executeAnalysis()
printfn $"🎯 Metascript execution completed with {result:P0} ecosystem health"
