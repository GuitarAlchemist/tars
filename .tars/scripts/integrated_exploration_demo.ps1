METASCRIPT RECOVERY RESOLUTION

PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
The metascript '$MetascriptName' was stuck due to: $StuckReason

EXPLORATION FINDINGS:
1. Deep analysis revealed unclear requirements and technology uncertainty
2. Alternative approaches identified iterative refinement strategies
3. Web research provided best practices for autonomous code generation
4. Pattern matching found successful resolution patterns in project memory

RECOMMENDED SOLUTION:
1. Implement technology detection algorithm with confidence scoring
2. Break down user request into specific, actionable components
3. Use iterative file generation with validation at each step
4. Implement fallback strategies for uncertain conditions
5. Add user clarification prompts for ambiguous requirements

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
1. Update metascript to include technology detection phase
2. Add requirement clarification and breakdown logic
3. Implement iterative generation with progress tracking
4. Add validation and quality checks at each step
5. Create fallback mechanisms for edge cases

CONFIDENCE: 85%
ESTIMATED SUCCESS RATE: 90%
IMPLEMENTATION TIME: 15 minutes

NEXT ACTIONS:
1. Apply the recommended solution to the stuck metascript
2. Test the updated metascript with the original user request
3. Monitor execution and validate successful completion
4. Update project memory with successful recovery pattern
