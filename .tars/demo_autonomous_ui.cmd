echo 🚀 Starting TARS Autonomous UI Evolution...
echo.

REM Run the autonomous UI evolution metascript
echo 📋 Executing: autonomous_ui_evolution.trsx
echo.
dotnet run --project "../../TarsEngine.FSharp.Cli/TarsEngine.FSharp.Cli.fsproj" -- run ".tars/metascripts/autonomous_ui_evolution.trsx"

echo.
echo 🌐 Opening evolved UI in browser...
echo.

REM Open the generated UI
start "" ".tars/projects/tars_evolved_ui.html"

echo.
echo ✅ Demo complete! 
echo.
echo 🎯 What you just witnessed:
echo    • TARS analyzed its own system state
echo    • Generated F# React components based on current needs
echo    • Created responsive layouts dynamically
echo    • Deployed the UI with hot reload capabilities
echo.
echo 🔄 In a full implementation, this would happen continuously:
echo    • Every few seconds, TARS re-analyzes its state
echo    • Components are added, modified, or removed as needed
echo    • The UI evolves to match system requirements
echo    • Users see a living, breathing interface that adapts
echo.
echo 💡 Key Features Demonstrated:
echo    • Autonomous component generation
echo    • Real-time UI adaptation
echo    • Performance-based UI changes
echo    • Agent activity monitoring
echo    • Zero-downtime deployments
