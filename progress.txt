# TARS Implementation Progress

## Project Structure Information
- Project Root: C:\Users\spare\source\repos\tars
- All files should be created within this directory
- Augment code should use full paths starting with C:\Users\spare\source\repos\tars\

## Story: Implement TARS DSL Core Structure
Status: In Progress

### Tasks:
- [x] Create initial project structure
- [x] Define basic DSL types and interfaces
- [x] Implement TarsBuilder computational expression
- [x] Create basic data source connectors (FILE, API)
- [x] Implement async task execution
- [x] Add prompt-based improvement capabilities
- [x] Create simple examples demonstrating the DSL
- [x] Implement advanced data processing capabilities
- [x] Add support for external AI services integration
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation
- [x] Add self-evaluation metrics for AI-generated improvements
- [ ] Implement blue/green deployment for AI-generated code
- [ ] Create a plugin system for extensibility
- [ ] Add Blazor Server UI with MudBlazor for TARS interaction
- [ ] Implement AI coding assistant integration improvements

### Notes:
- Starting with F# implementation based on exploration documents
- Using computational expressions for the DSL syntax
- Will implement the core structure first, then add self-improvement capabilities
- Implemented basic TarsBuilder with support for FileData, ApiData, and WebSearch data sources
- Added computational expression methods (Bind, Return, etc.) to support F# workflow syntax
- Created example usage pattern for the DSL
- Added DataProcessing module with support for various transformations (Filter, Map, Aggregate, GroupBy, Join, Sort, Limit)
- Implemented JSON serialization/deserialization for data interchange
- Created ProcessingResult type to track metadata about transformations
- Added self-evaluation module to assess execution efficiency, parsing accuracy, and AI improvement success
- Integrated external AI services for code improvement and analysis
- Created documentation with examples demonstrating DSL usage patterns
- PromptEngine module implemented with summarize, analyze, and generate capabilities
- TarsEngineService created as C# wrapper for F# implementation
- Explored F# Type Providers for dynamic data integration and self-adaptation
- Researched hybrid approach using Roslyn for code analysis and F# for dynamic adaptation

## Next Steps:
1. Complete blue/green deployment for AI-generated code
2. Create a plugin system for extensibility
3. Implement rollback mechanism for failed AI optimizations
4. Enable meta-learning for TARS to predict new optimization strategies
5. Expand multi-agent system for competing and refining execution strategies
6. Implement Blazor Server UI with MudBlazor components for:
   - Running TARS auto-improvement processes
   - Processing epics/stories/spikes via prompt input
   - File upload functionality via dropzone
7. Improve AI coding assistant integration:
   - File management verification to ensure correct file locations
   - Smart code patch detection to prevent unnecessary file creation
   - Multi-step AI interaction for guided code generation

## Spike: Research Programming Language Design
Status: Completed

### Findings:
- F# computational expressions provide an excellent foundation for the DSL
- The DSL can blend functional programming with prompt-driven elements
- Implemented basic data source types that can be extended for real data processing
- The builder pattern allows for a natural, fluent syntax for defining AI workflows
- Enhanced implementation with direct prompt-driven operations (Summarize, Analyze, Generate, Improve)
- Added custom operations for more expressive DSL syntax
- Created examples demonstrating self-improving workflows
- Successfully integrated natural language prompts with functional programming constructs
- The DSL now supports both data-oriented and prompt-driven operations in a unified syntax
- F# Type Providers enable real-time adaptation without recompilation
- Blue/green deployment possible through dynamic loading of configurations

## Spike: AI Coding Assistant Integration
Status: Planned

### Goals:
- Improve interaction with coding assistants (Augment Code, Windsurf AI, Cursor AI)
- Implement file management verification to ensure correct file locations
- Create smart code patch detection to prevent unnecessary file creation
- Develop multi-step AI interaction for guided code generation
- Add self-healing rollback mechanism for failed AI-generated improvements
