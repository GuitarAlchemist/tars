# TARS Engine F# Migration Plan

## Motivation

The current mixed C#/F# architecture in TARS is causing several issues:

1. **Namespace Collisions**: Duplicate types and namespaces between C# and F# components
2. **Type Mismatches**: Interoperability issues between languages
3. **Maintenance Complexity**: Maintaining code in two languages increases cognitive load
4. **Conceptual Mismatch**: Object-oriented paradigms in C# vs. functional paradigms in F#

F# offers significant advantages for the TARS engine:
- Immutability by default reduces side effects
- Pattern matching for more expressive code
- Discriminated unions for better type modeling
- Better composition and higher-order functions
- More concise code

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Fix Existing F# Code and Establish Foundation (Current Sprint)

1. **Fix Existing F# Compilation Errors**
   - Resolve type mismatches in `TarsEngine.TreeOfThought`
   - Fix issues in `MetascriptGeneration.fs` and `MetascriptToT.fs`

2. **Create Clean F# Core Library**
   - Establish `TarsEngine.FSharp.Core` with proper namespaces
   - Define core types and interfaces
   - Implement basic utility functions

3. **Establish Interoperability Layer**
   - Create adapter patterns for C#/F# communication
   - Define clear boundaries between languages

### Phase 2: Migrate Core Algorithm Components (Next Sprint)

1. **Tree-of-Thought Implementation**
   - Migrate `TarsEngine.Services.TreeOfThought` to F#
   - Implement proper type hierarchies
   - Add comprehensive unit tests

2. **Code Analysis Services**
   - Migrate pattern detection and analysis to F#
   - Implement functional approach to code transformation

3. **Metascript Engine**
   - Reimplement metascript execution in F#
   - Create functional DSL for metascripts

### Phase 3: Migrate Domain Services (Future Sprint)

1. **Knowledge Repository**
   - Consolidate duplicate implementations
   - Migrate to F# with immutable data structures

2. **AI Services**
   - Migrate model interaction to F#
   - Implement functional approach to prompt engineering

3. **Compilation Services**
   - Migrate code generation to F#
   - Implement functional approach to AST manipulation

### Phase 4: Integration and Optimization (Future Sprint)

1. **CLI Integration**
   - Update CLI to use F# implementations
   - Maintain C# for user interface components

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize F# code for performance
   - Implement parallel processing where appropriate

3. **Documentation and Examples**
   - Create comprehensive documentation
   - Provide examples of F# usage

## Migration Guidelines

1. **Namespace Structure**
   - Use `TarsEngine.FSharp.*` for all F# components
   - Avoid namespace collisions with existing C# code

2. **Type Design**
   - Prefer immutable types
   - Use discriminated unions for state representation
   - Leverage F# record types for data structures

3. **Functional Patterns**
   - Use composition over inheritance
   - Implement pure functions where possible
   - Leverage higher-order functions

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Write tests before migration
   - Ensure behavior parity after migration
   - Add property-based tests where appropriate

5. **Interoperability**
   - Define clear interfaces for C# consumption
   - Use explicit type annotations at boundaries
   - Minimize cross-language dependencies

## Success Criteria

1. **Compilation Success**: All F# code compiles without errors
2. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite passes
3. **Performance**: Equal or better performance than C# implementation
4. **Maintainability**: Reduced code complexity and improved readability
5. **Extensibility**: Easier to add new features and capabilities
