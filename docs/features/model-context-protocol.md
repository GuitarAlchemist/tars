# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

TARS implements Anthropic's [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol), a standard that enables AI assistants to interact with tools and services. This integration allows TARS to function as an MCP service and collaborate with other MCP-compatible systems like Augment Code.

## What is the Model Context Protocol?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard developed by Anthropic that defines how AI assistants can interact with external tools and services. It provides a structured way for AI models to:

1. Request access to tools
2. Call tools with specific parameters
3. Receive and process tool responses
4. Handle errors and exceptions

MCP enables more powerful AI assistants by giving them the ability to interact with the outside world in a standardized, secure way.

## TARS MCP Implementation

TARS implements MCP in two ways:

1. **As a Tool User**: TARS can use MCP to call external tools and services
2. **As a Service**: TARS can function as an MCP service that other systems can interact with

### Key Features

- **Tool-Using Capabilities**: Access and use tools through a standardized protocol
- **Triple-Quoted Syntax**: Use `"""..."""` syntax for multi-line code blocks
- **Terminal Command Execution**: Execute terminal commands with proper authorization
- **Augment Code Integration**: Seamless collaboration with Augment Code through MCP
- **Structured Communication**: Standardized JSON format for tool requests and responses

## Available MCP Tools

TARS provides several built-in tools through its MCP implementation:

### Terminal Commands

Execute terminal commands and receive the output:

```json
{
  "type": "terminal",
  "command": "echo Hello, World!",
  "auto_execute": true
}
```

### Code Generation

Generate and save code to files:

```json
{
  "type": "code",
  "path": "path/to/file.cs",
  "content": "using System;\n\npublic class Program\n{\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\n    }\n}"
}
```

### System Status

Get information about the system status:

```json
{
  "type": "status",
  "query": "memory"
}
```

### TARS-Specific Operations

Perform TARS-specific operations:

```json
{
  "type": "tars",
  "operation": "self-analyze",
  "parameters": {
    "file": "path/to/file.cs",
    "model": "llama3"
  }
}
```

## Using MCP in TARS CLI

### Starting the MCP Service

```bash
# Start the MCP service on the default port (8999)
dotnet run --project TarsCli/TarsCli.csproj -- mcp start

# Start the MCP service on a specific port
dotnet run --project TarsCli/TarsCli.csproj -- mcp start --port 9000
```

### Configuring MCP

```bash
# Configure which tools are available
dotnet run --project TarsCli/TarsCli.csproj -- mcp config --tools terminal,code,status,tars

# Enable or disable auto-execution of commands
dotnet run --project TarsCli/TarsCli.csproj -- mcp config --auto-execute true
```

### Executing Commands Directly

```bash
# Execute a terminal command
dotnet run --project TarsCli/TarsCli.csproj -- mcp execute "echo Hello, World!"

# Generate code
dotnet run --project TarsCli/TarsCli.csproj -- mcp code path/to/file.cs -triple-quoted """
using System;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
"""
```

## Integration with Augment Code

TARS can integrate with Augment Code through the MCP protocol, allowing for seamless collaboration between the two systems.

### Setting Up Integration

1. Start the TARS MCP service:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project TarsCli/TarsCli.csproj -- mcp start --port 8999
   ```

2. Configure Augment Code to use the TARS MCP service:
   - Set the MCP server URL to `http://localhost:8999/`
   - Enable the tools you want to make available

3. Start using Augment Code with TARS capabilities

### Benefits of Integration

- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Combine the strengths of both TARS and Augment Code
- **Seamless Workflow**: Work with both systems without switching contexts
- **Shared Knowledge**: Both systems can access and build on each other's outputs
- **Standardized Communication**: Clear, structured communication between systems

## Security Considerations

When using MCP, especially with auto-execution enabled, consider these security best practices:

- **Limit Tool Access**: Only enable the tools that are necessary
- **Review Commands**: Review commands before execution when possible
- **Set Boundaries**: Define clear boundaries for what tools can and cannot do
- **Monitor Activity**: Keep track of tool usage and review logs regularly

## Future Directions

The TARS MCP implementation will continue to evolve with these planned enhancements:

- **Additional Tools**: Support for more specialized tools
- **Enhanced Security**: More granular permission controls
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Enable multiple agents to collaborate through MCP
- **Custom Tool Definitions**: Allow users to define their own tools
- **Cloud Integration**: Connect to cloud services through MCP
