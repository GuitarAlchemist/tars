# TARS Self-Coding

TARS Self-Coding is a feature that enables TARS to analyze, improve, and test its own code using a swarm of specialized TARS replicas running in Docker containers.

## Overview

The TARS Self-Coding feature consists of the following components:

1. **TARS Replica Manager**: Manages a swarm of TARS replicas in Docker containers.
2. **Self-Coding Workflow**: Coordinates the self-coding process across replicas.
3. **Specialized TARS Replicas**: Different replicas specialize in different aspects of self-coding.
4. **Command Interface**: Provides a command-line interface for managing the self-coding process.

## Architecture

The TARS Self-Coding architecture is designed to be modular and extensible:

### TARS Replicas

TARS Self-Coding uses four specialized replicas:

1. **Analyzer Replica**: Analyzes code for improvement opportunities.
2. **Generator Replica**: Generates improved code based on analysis.
3. **Tester Replica**: Tests the improved code to ensure it works correctly.
4. **Coordinator Replica**: Orchestrates the self-coding workflow.

### Self-Coding Workflow

The self-coding workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **File Selection**: The coordinator selects a file to improve.
2. **Code Analysis**: The analyzer examines the file for improvement opportunities.
3. **Code Generation**: The generator creates improved code based on the analysis.
4. **Testing**: The tester validates the improved code.
5. **Code Application**: The coordinator applies the improved code.
6. **Learning**: The coordinator records successful patterns for future use.

## Using TARS Self-Coding

### Setting Up the Environment

To set up the TARS Self-Coding environment, use the `self-code setup` command:

```bash
tarscli self-code setup
```

This command will:
1. Create a Docker network for TARS replicas
2. Create the specialized TARS replicas
3. Configure the replicas for self-coding

### Starting the Self-Coding Process

To start the self-coding process, use the `self-code start` command:

```bash
tarscli self-code start --target <directories> [--auto-apply]
```

Options:
- `--target` or `-t`: Directories to target for self-coding (required)
- `--auto-apply` or `-a`: Automatically apply improvements (default: false)

### Checking the Status

To check the status of the self-coding process, use the `self-code status` command:

```bash
tarscli self-code status
```

This will display information about the current state of the self-coding process, including:
- Current status (running, completed, failed, etc.)
- Current stage (initializing, scanning, processing, etc.)
- Current file being processed
- Statistics (files processed, improvements made, etc.)

### Stopping the Process

To stop the self-coding process, use the `self-code stop` command:

```bash
tarscli self-code stop
```

### Running the Demo

To see the TARS Self-Coding feature in action, run the demo:

```bash
tarscli demo self-code-demo
```

## Configuration

The TARS Self-Coding feature is configured in the `appsettings.json` file:

```json
"Tars": {
  "Replicas": {
    "ConfigPath": "config/tars-replicas.json",
    "DockerComposeTemplatePath": "templates/docker-compose-tars-replica.yml",
    "DockerComposeOutputDir": "docker/tars-replicas"
  },
  "SelfCoding": {
    "AutoApply": false,
    "DefaultModel": "llama3",
    "WorkflowStatePath": "data/self-coding/workflow-state.json",
    "TargetDirectories": ["TarsCli", "TarsEngine", "TarsEngine.SelfImprovement"]
  }
}
```

## Implementation Details

### TarsReplicaManager

The `TarsReplicaManager` is responsible for managing the TARS replicas. It provides methods for:

- Creating replicas
- Starting replicas
- Stopping replicas
- Removing replicas
- Getting replica status
- Sending requests to replicas

### SelfCodingWorkflow

The `SelfCodingWorkflow` coordinates the self-coding process. It:

1. Creates and manages the specialized replicas
2. Gets all files in the target directories
3. Processes each file through the self-coding pipeline:
   - Analyze the file for improvement opportunities
   - Generate improvements if needed
   - Apply improvements if auto-apply is enabled
   - Test the improved code
4. Records the results for future learning

### Docker Integration

TARS Self-Coding uses Docker to run replicas in containers. Each replica has its own Docker Compose file and container. The replica manager creates and manages these containers.

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for TARS Self-Coding include:

1. **More Specialized Replicas**: Additional replicas for specific tasks like documentation generation, refactoring, etc.
2. **Learning and Adaptation**: Replicas that learn from their experiences and improve their coding strategies.
3. **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Replicas that work together to solve complex coding problems.
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated self-improvement.
5. **GitHub Integration**: Automatic creation of pull requests for improvements.

## Conclusion

TARS Self-Coding is a powerful feature that enables TARS to improve itself autonomously. By deploying a swarm of specialized replicas in Docker containers, TARS can analyze, improve, and test its own code without human intervention, leading to continuous improvement and evolution.
