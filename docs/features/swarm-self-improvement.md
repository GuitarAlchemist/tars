# Swarm Self-Improvement

The Swarm Self-Improvement feature of TARS enables autonomous self-improvement using a swarm of MCP agents running in Docker containers. This feature allows TARS to analyze, improve, and test its own code without human intervention.

## Overview

The Swarm Self-Improvement process consists of the following steps:

1. **Deployment**: Deploy a swarm of specialized MCP agents in Docker containers.
2. **Analysis**: Analyze code for potential improvements.
3. **Generation**: Generate improved code based on the analysis.
4. **Application**: Apply the improvements to the codebase.
5. **Testing**: Test the improved code to ensure it works correctly.
6. **Learning**: Learn from the results to improve future self-improvement.

## Architecture

The Swarm Self-Improvement architecture is designed to be modular and extensible:

- **SwarmSelfImprovementService**: Coordinates the self-improvement process.
- **TarsMcpSwarmService**: Manages the swarm of MCP agents.
- **Agent Roles**: Different agents specialize in different aspects of self-improvement.
- **Workflow Engine**: Executes the self-improvement workflow with state management.
- **Learning Database**: Records improvements and feedback for future learning.

## Agent Roles

The self-improvement process uses agents with different roles:

- **Code Analyzer**: Analyzes code for potential improvements.
- **Code Generator**: Generates improved code based on analysis.
- **Test Generator**: Generates and runs tests for the improved code.
- **Documentation Generator**: Updates documentation to reflect the improvements.
- **Project Manager**: Coordinates the self-improvement process and prioritizes tasks.

## Using Swarm Self-Improvement

To use the Swarm Self-Improvement feature, use the `swarm-improve` command:

```bash
# Start the self-improvement process
tarscli swarm-improve start --target <directories> [--agent-count <count>] [--model <model>]

# Stop the self-improvement process
tarscli swarm-improve stop

# Get the status of the self-improvement process
tarscli swarm-improve status
```

### Example

```bash
# Start self-improvement for the TarsCli and TarsEngine projects with 5 agents
tarscli swarm-improve start --target TarsCli TarsEngine --agent-count 5 --model llama3
```

## Configuration

The Swarm Self-Improvement feature is configured in the `appsettings.json` file:

```json
"Tars": {
  "McpSwarm": {
    "ConfigPath": "config/mcp-swarm.json",
    "DockerComposeTemplatePath": "templates/docker-compose-mcp-agent.yml",
    "DockerComposeOutputDir": "docker/mcp-agents"
  },
  "SelfImprovement": {
    "AutoApply": false,
    "DefaultModel": "llama3",
    "TargetDirectories": ["TarsCli", "TarsEngine", "TarsEngine.SelfImprovement"]
  }
}
```

## Implementation Details

### SwarmSelfImprovementService

The `SwarmSelfImprovementService` is responsible for coordinating the self-improvement process. It:

1. Creates a swarm of agents with different roles.
2. Gets all files in the target directories.
3. Processes each file through the self-improvement pipeline:
   - Analyze the file for potential improvements.
   - Generate improvements if needed.
   - Apply improvements if auto-apply is enabled.
4. Records the results for future learning.

### Self-Improvement Pipeline

The self-improvement pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. **Analysis**: The code analyzer agent analyzes the file for potential improvements.
2. **Improvement Generation**: The code generator agent generates improvements based on the analysis.
3. **Improvement Application**: The improvements are applied to the file.
4. **Testing**: The test generator agent generates and runs tests for the improved code.
5. **Documentation**: The documentation generator agent updates documentation to reflect the improvements.

### Learning and Feedback

The self-improvement process includes a learning and feedback loop:

1. **Record Results**: Record the results of each improvement attempt.
2. **Analyze Patterns**: Analyze patterns in successful and unsuccessful improvements.
3. **Adjust Strategies**: Adjust improvement strategies based on the analysis.
4. **Generate New Patterns**: Generate new improvement patterns based on successful improvements.

## CI/CD Integration

The Swarm Self-Improvement feature can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Continuous Improvement**: Run the self-improvement process as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
2. **Automated Testing**: Test the improved code automatically.
3. **Pull Request Generation**: Generate pull requests for approved improvements.
4. **Deployment**: Deploy the improved code to production.

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the Swarm Self-Improvement feature include:

1. **Autonomous Learning**: Agents that learn from their experiences and improve their improvement strategies.
2. **Collaborative Improvement**: Agents that collaborate to solve complex improvement tasks.
3. **Distributed Processing**: Agents that can run on multiple machines for better scalability.
4. **Improvement Prioritization**: Smarter prioritization of improvement tasks based on impact and difficulty.
5. **User Feedback Integration**: Integration of user feedback into the improvement process.

## Conclusion

The Swarm Self-Improvement feature is a powerful capability of TARS that enables autonomous self-improvement. By deploying a swarm of specialized agents in Docker containers, TARS can analyze, improve, and test its own code without human intervention, leading to continuous improvement and evolution.
