## Usage

### Measuring Intelligence

To measure TARS's intelligence:

```csharp
var intelligenceMeasurer = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IntelligenceMeasurer>();
await intelligenceMeasurer.InitializeAsync();

// Measure overall intelligence
var intelligenceProfile = await intelligenceMeasurer.MeasureIntelligenceAsync();
Console.WriteLine($"Overall intelligence score: {intelligenceProfile.CompositeScore:F2}");

// Measure specific intelligence dimensions
var problemSolvingScore = await intelligenceMeasurer.MeasureDimensionAsync(IntelligenceDimension.ProblemSolving);
Console.WriteLine($"Problem-solving intelligence: {problemSolvingScore:F2}");
```

### Running Benchmarks

To run intelligence benchmarks:

```csharp
var benchmarkSystem = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<BenchmarkSystem>();
await benchmarkSystem.InitializeAsync();

// Run all benchmarks
var benchmarkResults = await benchmarkSystem.RunAllBenchmarksAsync();
Console.WriteLine($"Benchmark completion: {benchmarkResults.CompletionRate:P2}");
Console.WriteLine($"Average benchmark score: {benchmarkResults.AverageScore:F2}");

// Run specific benchmark
var problemSolvingBenchmark = await benchmarkSystem.RunBenchmarkAsync(BenchmarkType.ProblemSolving);
Console.WriteLine($"Problem-solving benchmark score: {problemSolvingBenchmark.Score:F2}");
```
