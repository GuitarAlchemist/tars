# Triple-Quoted Syntax for Code Generation

This document provides detailed information about the triple-quoted syntax (`"""..."""`) for code generation in TARS.

## Overview

The triple-quoted syntax is a feature that allows for multi-line code blocks to be passed as arguments to TARS commands. This is particularly useful for code generation, where the code may span multiple lines and contain special characters.

## Syntax

The triple-quoted syntax uses three double quotes (`"""`) to delimit the start and end of a code block:

```
"""
code block
with multiple lines
"""
```

## Usage with MCP Commands

The triple-quoted syntax is primarily used with the `mcp code` command to generate code files:

```bash
dotnet run --project TarsCli/TarsCli.csproj -- mcp code path/to/file.cs -triple-quoted """
using System;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
"""
```

## Benefits

The triple-quoted syntax offers several benefits:

1. **Multi-line Support**: Easily include code that spans multiple lines
2. **Special Character Handling**: No need to escape special characters like quotes
3. **Readability**: Code is more readable when formatted naturally
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to update and modify code blocks

## Implementation Details

The triple-quoted syntax is implemented using a custom argument parser that:

1. Detects triple-quoted blocks in command-line arguments
2. Combines multi-line content into a single argument
3. Removes the triple quotes from the content
4. Passes the content to the appropriate command handler

## Examples

### Generate a Simple C# Class

```bash
dotnet run --project TarsCli/TarsCli.csproj -- mcp code SimpleClass.cs -triple-quoted """
using System;

public class SimpleClass
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    
    public SimpleClass(string name)
    {
        Name = name;
    }
    
    public void SayHello()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {Name}!");
    }
}
"""
```

### Generate a JSON Configuration File

```bash
dotnet run --project TarsCli/TarsCli.csproj -- mcp code config.json -triple-quoted """
{
    "appName": "TARS",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "settings": {
        "logLevel": "Info",
        "maxThreads": 4,
        "timeout": 30000
    },
    "features": [
        "CodeGeneration",
        "TerminalExecution",
        "AgentCoordination"
    ]
}
"""
```

### Generate an HTML File

```bash
dotnet run --project TarsCli/TarsCli.csproj -- mcp code index.html -triple-quoted """
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>TARS Project</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            margin: 0;
            padding: 20px;
        }
        h1 {
            color: #333;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to TARS</h1>
    <p>This is a sample HTML file generated by TARS.</p>
</body>
</html>
"""
```

## Best Practices

When using the triple-quoted syntax:

1. **Indentation**: Maintain consistent indentation for readability
2. **Line Breaks**: Use appropriate line breaks to structure the code
3. **Comments**: Include comments to explain complex sections
4. **Validation**: Verify the generated code after creation

## Limitations

The triple-quoted syntax has a few limitations:

1. **Command-Line Parsing**: Some shells may have issues with multi-line input
2. **Escaping**: Triple quotes within the code block may need special handling
3. **Length**: Very long code blocks may be better placed in separate files

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the triple-quoted syntax include:

1. **Syntax Highlighting**: Support for syntax highlighting in the CLI
2. **Template Variables**: Support for variables within triple-quoted blocks
3. **Code Formatting**: Automatic formatting of generated code
4. **Language Detection**: Automatic detection of the programming language
