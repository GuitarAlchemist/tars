# TARS History: TarsApp Build Fixes

**Date:** 2025/04/07

## Overview

This milestone marks the successful resolution of build errors and warnings in the TarsApp project. The fixes addressed type conversion issues, EventCallback mismatches, and other compatibility problems that were preventing the TarsApp project from building successfully.

## Key Achievements

1. **Fixed LogEntry/ExecutionLog Conversion Issues**
   - Added conversion methods in ModelConverters.cs to properly convert between TarsEngine.Models.ExecutionLog and TarsApp.Models.LogEntry
   - Updated references to use the correct property names (LogLevel instead of Level)

2. **Fixed ExecutionOptions Type Mismatch**
   - Moved ExecutionOptions to a separate file in TarsApp.Models namespace
   - Updated references to use the shared class

3. **Fixed RollbackOptions Issues**
   - Simplified the RollbackDialog component to use a parameter-less callback
   - Created a local RollbackOptions variable in the HandleRollback method

4. **Fixed MudTable ServerData Function Signature Issues**
   - Updated the ServerReload method to include the CancellationToken parameter
   - Fixed the MudTable component to use the correct delegate type

5. **Fixed Non-nullable Field Warnings**
   - Added null! initializers to non-nullable fields

## Technical Details

The fixes involved careful analysis of type mismatches and conversion issues between the TarsEngine and TarsApp projects. Key components that were fixed include:

- **ModelConverters.cs**: Added methods to convert between engine and app model types
- **ExecutionMonitor.razor**: Fixed references to LogEntry properties
- **AutonomousExecution.razor**: Updated EventCallback handling
- **ExecutionsList.razor and ImprovementsList.razor**: Fixed ServerData function signatures
- **Various components**: Added null! initializers to non-nullable fields

## Impact

These fixes have successfully resolved all build errors in the TarsApp project, allowing it to build successfully with only warnings. This is a significant step forward in the development of the TARS project, as it enables further development and testing of the TarsApp user interface.

## Next Steps

1. Address remaining warnings in the TarsApp project
2. Implement additional features in the TarsApp user interface
3. Enhance the integration between TarsApp and TarsEngine
4. Improve the user experience of the autonomous execution features
