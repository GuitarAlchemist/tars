# Metascript Tree-of-Thought

This document provides an overview of the Metascript Tree-of-Thought implementation, which uses the Tree-of-Thought reasoning approach to generate, validate, execute, and analyze metascripts.

## Overview

The Tree-of-Thought reasoning approach is a technique that explores multiple solution paths simultaneously, evaluates them, and selects the most promising ones. This implementation applies this approach to metascripts, which are scripts used to generate and transform code.

The Metascript Tree-of-Thought implementation consists of the following components:

1. **Core F# Modules**: The core implementation of the Tree-of-Thought reasoning in F#
2. **C# Wrapper Service**: A C# service that wraps the F# implementation and provides a simple API
3. **CLI Command**: A command-line interface for working with metascripts using Tree-of-Thought reasoning

## CLI Command

The `MetascriptTreeOfThoughtCommand` class provides a command-line interface for working with metascripts using Tree-of-Thought reasoning:

- `generate`: Generates a metascript using Tree-of-Thought reasoning
- `validate`: Validates a metascript using Tree-of-Thought reasoning
- `execute`: Executes a metascript using Tree-of-Thought reasoning
- `analyze`: Analyzes the results of a metascript execution using Tree-of-Thought reasoning
- `pipeline`: Runs the complete metascript pipeline using Tree-of-Thought reasoning

## Usage

### Generating a Metascript

```bash
tars metascript-tot generate --template template.tars --values values.json --output metascript.tars
```

### Validating a Metascript

```bash
tars metascript-tot validate --metascript metascript.tars --report validation_report.md
```

### Executing a Metascript

```bash
tars metascript-tot execute --metascript metascript.tars --output output.txt --report execution_report.md
```

### Analyzing Results

```bash
tars metascript-tot analyze --output output.txt --execution-time 1000 --memory-usage 100 --error-count 0 --report analysis_report.md
```

### Running the Complete Pipeline

```bash
tars metascript-tot pipeline --template template.tars --values values.json --output-dir pipeline_output
```

## Example

Here's an example of a simple metascript template:

```
DESCRIBE {
    name: "Example Metascript"
    description: "A simple example metascript"
    version: "1.0.0"
}

VARIABLE input {
    type: "string"
    description: "The input value"
    default: "${default_input}"
}

FUNCTION process {
    input: "${input}"
    output: "Processed: ${input}"
}

ACTION run {
    function: "process"
    input: "${input}"
}
```

And a values file:

```
default_input=Hello, World!
```

You can generate a metascript from this template using the following command:

```bash
tars metascript-tot generate --template template.tars --values values.json --output metascript.tars
```

This will generate a metascript with the placeholder `${default_input}` replaced with `Hello, World!`.

## Integration with TARS

The Metascript Tree-of-Thought implementation is integrated with the TARS auto-improvement pipeline, allowing for more sophisticated metascript generation, validation, execution, and analysis.

This integration enables TARS to:

1. **Generate Better Metascripts**: Use Tree-of-Thought reasoning to generate more effective metascripts
2. **Validate Metascripts More Thoroughly**: Use Tree-of-Thought reasoning to validate metascripts more thoroughly
3. **Execute Metascripts More Efficiently**: Use Tree-of-Thought reasoning to execute metascripts more efficiently
4. **Analyze Results More Effectively**: Use Tree-of-Thought reasoning to analyze the results of metascript execution more effectively

## Future Work

Future work on the Metascript Tree-of-Thought implementation includes:

1. **Improved Evaluation Metrics**: Develop more sophisticated evaluation metrics for different aspects of metascript generation, validation, execution, and analysis
2. **Enhanced Branching Strategies**: Implement more advanced branching strategies to explore a wider range of solution paths
3. **Better Pruning Techniques**: Develop more effective pruning techniques to focus on the most promising solution paths
4. **Integration with Machine Learning**: Integrate machine learning techniques to improve the Tree-of-Thought reasoning process
5. **Support for More Complex Metascripts**: Extend the implementation to support more complex metascript structures and operations
