# TARS Project Status

This document tracks the status and important milestones of the TARS project. It serves as a historical record of the project's development and evolution.

## Current Status (April 2025)

### Core Components
- **TARS Engine**: Functional with basic DSL parsing and execution capabilities
- **TARS CLI**: Operational with commands for executing metascripts, running demos, and performing self-improvement
- **DSL Engine**: Basic implementation complete, capable of parsing and executing simple metascripts
- **Self-Improvement System**: Framework implemented with workflow engine, but actual improvement steps need real implementation

### Recent Achievements
- Fixed build issues in TarsEngine.SelfImprovement project
- Implemented workflow state management for autonomous improvement
- Created basic structure for the self-improvement workflow steps (knowledge extraction, code analysis, improvement application, feedback collection, reporting)
- Integrated with Augment Code for enhanced development capabilities

### Current Limitations
- Self-improvement workflow steps are mostly placeholders with simulated functionality
- Integration between metascripts and self-improvement system is incomplete
- Documentation processing capabilities for extracting knowledge from exploration chats are not yet implemented
- Autonomous improvement of documentation is not yet functional
