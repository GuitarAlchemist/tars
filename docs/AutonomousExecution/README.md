# Autonomous Execution System

The Autonomous Execution System is a component of TARS that enables safe, automated execution of code improvements. It provides a robust framework for planning, executing, validating, and rolling back changes to the codebase.

## Overview

The Autonomous Execution System is designed to safely apply improvements to the codebase with minimal human intervention. It includes the following components:

1. **Execution Planning**: Creates and validates execution plans for improvements
2. **Safe Execution Environment**: Provides an isolated environment for applying changes
3. **Change Validation**: Ensures changes meet quality and functionality requirements
4. **Rollback Management**: Provides mechanisms for reverting changes
5. **CLI Commands**: Provides a user interface for the system

## Architecture

The Autonomous Execution System follows a modular architecture with the following components:

### Execution Planning

The Execution Planning component is responsible for creating and validating execution plans. It includes:

- **Execution Plan**: Represents a plan for executing an improvement
- **Execution Step**: Represents a step in an execution plan
- **Execution Context**: Represents the context for executing an improvement

### Safe Execution Environment

The Safe Execution Environment component provides an isolated environment for applying changes. It includes:

- **Safe Execution Environment**: Coordinates between virtual file system and permission manager
- **Virtual File System**: Implements a virtual file system layer with rollback capability
- **Permission Manager**: Manages security permissions for execution

### Change Validation

The Change Validation component ensures changes meet quality and functionality requirements. It includes:

- **Change Validator**: Coordinates between syntax validator, semantic validator, and test executor
- **Syntax Validator**: Validates syntax of code changes
- **Semantic Validator**: Validates semantic correctness of code changes
- **Test Executor**: Executes tests to validate changes

### Rollback Management

The Rollback Management component provides mechanisms for reverting changes. It includes:

- **Rollback Manager**: Coordinates between file backup, transaction, and audit services
- **File Backup Service**: Provides backup functionality for files
- **Transaction Manager**: Implements transaction-like execution for changes
- **Audit Trail Service**: Records all changes made to the system

### CLI Commands

The CLI Commands component provides a user interface for the system. It includes:

- **Autonomous Execution Command**: Main command for autonomous execution
- **Execute Subcommand**: Executes improvements
- **Monitor Subcommand**: Monitors execution progress
- **Review Subcommand**: Reviews and approves changes
- **Rollback Subcommand**: Manages rollbacks
- **Status Subcommand**: Shows execution status

## Usage

### Executing Improvements

To execute an improvement, use the `execute improvement` command:

```bash
tarscli execute improvement --id <improvement-id> [options]
```

Options:
- `--dry-run`: Perform a dry run without making changes (default: false)
- `--backup`: Backup files before making changes (default: true)
- `--validate`: Validate changes before applying them (default: true)
- `--auto-rollback`: Automatically roll back on failure (default: true)
- `--output-dir`: The output directory for execution results

### Monitoring Execution

To monitor execution progress, use the `execute monitor` command:

```bash
tarscli execute monitor --context-id <context-id> [options]
```

Options:
- `--interval`: The monitoring interval in seconds (default: 5)
- `--timeout`: The monitoring timeout in seconds (default: 300)

### Reviewing Changes

To review and approve/reject changes, use the `execute review` command:

```bash
tarscli execute review --context-id <context-id> [options]
```

Options:
- `--approve`: Approve the changes (default: false)
- `--reject`: Reject the changes (default: false)
- `--comment`: A comment for the review

### Managing Rollbacks

To manage rollbacks, use the `execute rollback` command:

```bash
tarscli execute rollback --context-id <context-id> [options]
```

Options:
- `--transaction-id`: The transaction ID to roll back
- `--file-path`: The file path to roll back
- `--all`: Roll back all changes (default: false)
- `--force`: Force the rollback (default: false)

### Showing Execution Status

To show execution status, use the `execute status` command:

```bash
tarscli execute status [--context-id <context-id>] [options]
```

Options:
- `--detail`: Show detailed status (default: false)
- `--format`: The output format (text, json) (default: text)

## Examples

### Executing an Improvement

```bash
tarscli execute improvement --id IMP-123 --dry-run
```

This will execute the improvement with ID `IMP-123` in dry run mode, without making any actual changes.

### Monitoring Execution

```bash
tarscli execute monitor --context-id CTX-456 --interval 10 --timeout 600
```

This will monitor the execution context with ID `CTX-456`, checking progress every 10 seconds for up to 10 minutes.

### Reviewing Changes

```bash
tarscli execute review --context-id CTX-456 --approve --comment "Looks good!"
```

This will approve the changes in the execution context with ID `CTX-456` with the comment "Looks good!".

### Rolling Back Changes

```bash
tarscli execute rollback --context-id CTX-456 --all
```

This will roll back all changes in the execution context with ID `CTX-456`.

### Showing Execution Status

```bash
tarscli execute status --context-id CTX-456 --detail
```

This will show detailed status information for the execution context with ID `CTX-456`.

## Best Practices

### Execution Planning

- Create small, focused execution plans for better manageability
- Validate execution plans before executing them
- Use dependencies to ensure steps are executed in the correct order

### Safe Execution

- Always use backup when making changes to important files
- Use dry run mode to test changes before applying them
- Set appropriate permissions for execution

### Validation

- Validate changes at multiple levels: syntax, semantics, and tests
- Use test filters to focus on relevant tests
- Set appropriate validation options based on the context

### Rollback Management

- Create transaction boundaries for atomic operations
- Record operations for better auditability
- Use appropriate rollback strategies based on the context

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Execution Plan Validation Fails

- Check for cycles in the execution plan
- Ensure all dependencies exist
- Verify that the execution plan is well-formed

#### Changes Fail Validation

- Check for syntax errors in the code
- Look for semantic issues like undefined variables
- Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved

#### Rollback Fails

- Check if backup files exist
- Verify that the rollback context is valid
- Ensure the file system is accessible

### Logging

The Autonomous Execution System logs detailed information about execution. To view logs, use the `execute status` command with the `--detail` option.
