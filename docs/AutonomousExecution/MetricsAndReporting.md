### File Metrics

| Metric | Description | Unit |
|--------|-------------|------|
| ModifiedFileCount | Number of modified files | Count |

| TotalLineCount | Total number of affected lines | Count |
| AddedLineCount | Number of added lines | Count |
| ModifiedLineCount | Number of modified lines | Count |
| DeletedLineCount | Number of deleted lines | Count |

## Accessing Metrics

Metrics can be accessed through the CLI using the `execute status` command:

```bash
tarscli execute status --context-id <context-id> --detail
```

This will show the metrics collected for the execution context.

## Generating Reports

The Autonomous Execution System can generate various reports to provide insights into execution performance and quality.

### Execution Summary Report

To generate an execution summary report, use the following command:

```bash
tarscli execute report --context-id <context-id> --type summary --output <output-file>
```

This will generate a summary report with the following information:

- Execution context information
- Execution metrics
- Validation metrics
- Rollback metrics
- File metrics

### Detailed Execution Report

To generate a detailed execution report, use the following command:

```bash
tarscli execute report --context-id <context-id> --type detailed --output <output-file>
```

This will generate a detailed report with the following information:

- Execution context information
- Execution metrics
- Validation metrics
- Rollback metrics
- File metrics
- Step-by-step execution details
- Validation results
- Rollback operations
- File changes

### Validation Report

To generate a validation report, use the following command:

```bash
tarscli execute report --context-id <context-id> --type validation --output <output-file>
```

This will generate a validation report with the following information:

- Validation metrics
- Syntax validation results
- Semantic validation results
- Test execution results
- Validation issues and warnings

### Rollback Report

To generate a rollback report, use the following command:

```bash
tarscli execute report --context-id <context-id> --type rollback --output <output-file>
```

This will generate a rollback report with the following information:

- Rollback metrics
- Backup operations
- Restore operations
- Transaction operations
- Rollback issues and warnings

### File Change Report

To generate a file change report, use the following command:

```bash
tarscli execute report --context-id <context-id> --type file-changes --output <output-file>
```

This will generate a file change report with the following information:

- File metrics
- Modified files with diff
- Created files
- Deleted files
- Line change statistics

### Custom Report

To generate a custom report, use the following command:

```bash
tarscli execute report --context-id <context-id> --type custom --metrics <metric1,metric2,...> --output <output-file>
```

This will generate a custom report with the specified metrics.

## Report Formats

Reports can be generated in various formats:

- Text: Plain text format
- JSON: JSON format for programmatic access
- HTML: HTML format for web viewing
- Markdown: Markdown format for documentation
- CSV: CSV format for data analysis

To specify the format, use the `--format` option:

```bash
tarscli execute report --context-id <context-id> --type summary --format html --output <output-file>
```

## Visualizing Metrics

The Autonomous Execution System provides visualization capabilities for metrics through the `execute visualize` command:

```bash
tarscli execute visualize --context-id <context-id> --type <visualization-type> --output <output-file>
```

Available visualization types:

- `progress`: Visualizes execution progress over time
- `validation`: Visualizes validation results
- `file-changes`: Visualizes file changes
- `performance`: Visualizes performance metrics
- `comparison`: Visualizes comparison between multiple executions

## Aggregating Metrics

To aggregate metrics across multiple execution contexts, use the `execute aggregate` command:

```bash
tarscli execute aggregate --context-ids <context-id1,context-id2,...> --metrics <metric1,metric2,...> --output <output-file>
```

This will generate an aggregated report with the specified metrics for the specified execution contexts.

## Exporting Metrics

To export metrics for external analysis, use the `execute export` command:

```bash
tarscli execute export --context-id <context-id> --format <format> --output <output-file>
```

Available export formats:

- `json`: JSON format
- `csv`: CSV format
- `xml`: XML format

## Best Practices

### Collecting Metrics

- Enable detailed metrics collection for important executions
- Use appropriate metrics based on the execution context
- Collect metrics at regular intervals for trend analysis

### Generating Reports

- Generate summary reports for quick overview
- Generate detailed reports for in-depth analysis
- Use appropriate report formats based on the audience
- Include relevant metrics in custom reports

### Analyzing Metrics

- Look for trends in execution performance
- Identify bottlenecks in the execution process
- Monitor validation quality over time
- Track rollback frequency and success rate

## Conclusion

The Metrics and Reporting Guide provides comprehensive information about the metrics collected by the Autonomous Execution System and how to generate reports. By leveraging these capabilities, you can gain valuable insights into the performance, quality, and efficiency of the system.
