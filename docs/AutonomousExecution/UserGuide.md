# User Guide for Autonomous Execution System

This guide provides detailed instructions for using the Autonomous Execution System to safely apply improvements to your codebase.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using the Autonomous Execution System, ensure you have:

1. TARS installed on your system
2. Access to the codebase you want to improve
3. Sufficient permissions to execute commands and modify files

### Installation

The Autonomous Execution System is included with TARS. To verify it's installed correctly, run:

```bash
tarscli execute --help
```

This should display the help information for the Autonomous Execution System.

## Basic Concepts

### Improvements

Improvements are changes to the codebase that enhance its quality, performance, or functionality. They can be generated automatically by TARS or created manually.

### Execution Plans

Execution plans are step-by-step instructions for applying improvements to the codebase. They include:

- Steps to be executed
- Dependencies between steps
- Validation rules
- Rollback procedures

### Execution Contexts

Execution contexts track the state of execution, including:

- Execution plan information
- Execution progress
- Modified files
- Validation results
- Logs and errors

### Transactions

Transactions group related operations to ensure atomicity. They can be committed or rolled back as a unit.

### Rollbacks

Rollbacks revert changes made during execution. They can be:

- Automatic: Triggered by validation failures
- Manual: Initiated by the user

## Basic Usage

### Listing Available Improvements

To list available improvements, use:

```bash
tarscli improve list
```

This will display a list of improvements that can be executed.

### Executing an Improvement

To execute an improvement, use:

```bash
tarscli execute improvement --id <improvement-id>
```

This will create an execution plan for the improvement and execute it.

### Monitoring Execution

To monitor the progress of execution, use:

```bash
tarscli execute monitor --context-id <context-id>
```

This will display the current status of the execution and update it periodically.

### Reviewing Changes

To review changes made during execution, use:

```bash
tarscli execute review --context-id <context-id>
```

This will display the changes made to the codebase and allow you to approve or reject them.

### Rolling Back Changes

To roll back changes made during execution, use:

```bash
tarscli execute rollback --context-id <context-id> --all
```

This will revert all changes made during execution.

### Viewing Execution Status

To view the status of an execution, use:

```bash
tarscli execute status --context-id <context-id>
```

This will display detailed information about the execution, including progress, logs, and errors.

## Advanced Usage

### Dry Run Mode

To execute an improvement without making actual changes, use:

```bash
tarscli execute improvement --id <improvement-id> --dry-run
```

This will simulate the execution without modifying the codebase.

### Validation Options

To control validation during execution, use:

```bash
tarscli execute improvement --id <improvement-id> --validate
```

This will validate changes before applying them.

### Auto-Rollback

To automatically roll back changes if validation fails, use:

```bash
tarscli execute improvement --id <improvement-id> --auto-rollback
```

This will revert changes if validation fails.

### Custom Output Directory

To specify a custom output directory for execution results, use:

```bash
tarscli execute improvement --id <improvement-id> --output-dir <output-dir>
```

This will store execution results in the specified directory.

### Transaction Management

To roll back a specific transaction, use:

```bash
tarscli execute rollback --context-id <context-id> --transaction-id <transaction-id>
```

This will revert changes made in the specified transaction.

### File Rollback

To roll back changes to a specific file, use:

```bash
tarscli execute rollback --context-id <context-id> --file-path <file-path>
```

This will revert changes made to the specified file.

### Detailed Status

To view detailed status information, use:

```bash
tarscli execute status --context-id <context-id> --detail
```

This will display comprehensive information about the execution.

### JSON Output

To get status information in JSON format, use:

```bash
tarscli execute status --context-id <context-id> --format json
```

This will output status information in JSON format for programmatic access.

## Workflows

### Basic Workflow

1. List available improvements:
   ```bash
   tarscli improve list
   ```

2. Execute an improvement:
   ```bash
   tarscli execute improvement --id <improvement-id>
   ```

3. Monitor execution:
   ```bash
   tarscli execute monitor --context-id <context-id>
   ```

4. Review changes:
   ```bash
   tarscli execute review --context-id <context-id>
   ```

5. Approve changes:
   ```bash
   tarscli execute review --context-id <context-id> --approve
   ```

### Cautious Workflow

1. List available improvements:
   ```bash
   tarscli improve list
   ```

2. Execute an improvement in dry run mode:
   ```bash
   tarscli execute improvement --id <improvement-id> --dry-run
   ```

3. Review the simulated changes:
   ```bash
   tarscli execute status --context-id <context-id> --detail
   ```

4. Execute the improvement with validation and auto-rollback:
   ```bash
   tarscli execute improvement --id <improvement-id> --validate --auto-rollback
   ```

5. Monitor execution:
   ```bash
   tarscli execute monitor --context-id <context-id>
   ```

6. Review changes:
   ```bash
   tarscli execute review --context-id <context-id>
   ```

7. Approve changes:
   ```bash
   tarscli execute review --context-id <context-id> --approve
   ```

### Batch Workflow

1. List available improvements:
   ```bash
   tarscli improve list
   ```

2. Execute multiple improvements:
   ```bash
   tarscli execute improvement --id <improvement-id1> --validate --auto-rollback
   tarscli execute improvement --id <improvement-id2> --validate --auto-rollback
   tarscli execute improvement --id <improvement-id3> --validate --auto-rollback
   ```

3. List execution contexts:
   ```bash
   tarscli execute status
   ```

4. Review and approve changes for each context:
   ```bash
   tarscli execute review --context-id <context-id1> --approve
   tarscli execute review --context-id <context-id2> --approve
   tarscli execute review --context-id <context-id3> --approve
   ```

## Best Practices

### Planning Execution

- Review improvements before execution
- Use dry run mode for critical changes
- Plan execution during low-traffic periods
- Ensure you have sufficient permissions

### Monitoring Execution

- Monitor execution progress regularly
- Check for warnings and errors
- Verify validation results
- Monitor system resources

### Reviewing Changes

- Review all changes carefully
- Verify that changes meet requirements
- Check for unintended side effects
- Consult with team members for critical changes

### Managing Rollbacks

- Create backups before execution
- Test rollback procedures
- Document rollback steps
- Verify system state after rollback

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Execution Plan Creation Fails

- Check if the improvement exists
- Verify that the improvement has valid content
- Ensure the improvement is in a valid state

#### Validation Fails

- Check for syntax errors in the code
- Look for semantic issues like undefined variables
- Ensure tests are passing

#### Rollback Fails

- Check if backup files exist
- Verify that the rollback context is valid
- Ensure the file system is accessible

### Error Messages

#### "Improvement not found"

- Verify the improvement ID
- Check if the improvement exists in the database
- Ensure you have access to the improvement

#### "Execution plan validation failed"

- Check for cycles in the execution plan
- Ensure all dependencies exist
- Verify that the execution plan is well-formed

#### "Validation failed"

- Check for syntax errors in the code
- Look for semantic issues like undefined variables
- Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved

#### "Rollback failed"

- Check if backup files exist
- Verify that the rollback context is valid
- Ensure the file system is accessible
