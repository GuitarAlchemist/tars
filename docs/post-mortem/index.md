# TARS Post-Mortem Analyses

This section contains post-mortem analyses of TARS features and implementations. These analyses provide insights into the strengths, weaknesses, and lessons learned from various aspects of the TARS project.

## Available Analyses

- [**Demo Command Analysis**](demo-analysis.md) - Analysis of the TARS demo command implementation and execution

## Purpose of Post-Mortem Analyses

Post-mortem analyses serve several important purposes:

1. **Documentation of Decisions**: They document the decisions made during implementation and the reasoning behind them.

2. **Identification of Strengths**: They highlight what worked well and should be continued in future implementations.

3. **Identification of Weaknesses**: They identify areas for improvement and potential issues to address.

4. **Knowledge Sharing**: They share knowledge and insights with the team and community.

5. **Continuous Improvement**: They provide a foundation for continuous improvement of the TARS project.

## Structure of Post-Mortem Analyses

Each post-mortem analysis typically includes:

1. **Overview**: A brief overview of the feature or implementation being analyzed.

2. **Implementation Details**: Details about how the feature was implemented, including components, architecture, and design decisions.

3. **Execution Results**: Results of executing or using the feature, including examples and outputs.

4. **Analysis**: An analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the implementation.

5. **Recommendations**: Recommendations for improving the feature or implementation.

6. **Conclusion**: A summary of the analysis and next steps.

## Contributing to Post-Mortem Analyses

If you have insights or feedback about a TARS feature or implementation, consider contributing to the post-mortem analyses. You can:

1. **Add Comments**: Add comments to existing analyses with your insights or experiences.

2. **Create New Analyses**: Create new analyses for features or implementations that haven't been analyzed yet.

3. **Update Existing Analyses**: Update existing analyses with new information or insights.

Your contributions help improve TARS and make it more useful for everyone.
