## Prompt:
What is the best path for  developing tars, should I create a Jetbrains extension to control Rider from tars? Should I use Claude desktop an use our own MCP server? Should I use Roslyn to guarantee the code compiles?  What is the best avenue to initiate an automated coding rétroaction loop that requires less human intervention than today's vibe coding tools?

## Response:
You're already far ahead in vision with TARS, and your goal is clear: **create a self-improving system with minimal human involvement**, capable of end-to-end software development, validation, and deployment. Let's break this down and sketch the best hybrid path—technically viable **today**, but extensible for **tomorrow’s capabilities**.

* * *

### **Objective:**

**Automated Coding Retroaction Loop** with TARS, minimizing human intervention, capable of:

*   Reading/understanding your codebase (via context).
    
*   Making intelligent modifications.
    
*   Validating correctness (compilation/tests).
    
*   Learning from prior iterations.
    
*   Eventually doing this _continuously_.
    

* * *

### **Best Hybrid Path to Start TARS Today:**

#### **1\. Use Roslyn for Static Validation + Refactoring**

*   **Yes, use Roslyn** as your backend validator and source code refactoring engine.
    
*   Roslyn is fully scriptable, allows you to:
    
    *   Parse/modify syntax trees.
        
    *   Guarantee compilation.
        
    *   Inject diagnostics and fixes.
        
    *   Generate before/after diffs for TARS retrospection.
        
*   Combine with NRefactory or custom analyzers for deeper logic.
    

> **Why**: It’s the only battle-tested .NET-native API that lets you truly “reason about code” and validate it **without launching Rider or VS**.

* * *

#### **2\. Skip Rider Plugin for Now** (unless you want GUI integration)

*   Controlling Rider via a plugin **is powerful** but:
    
    *   Tightly coupled with IDE state and user input.
        
    *   Harder to keep isolated from user-specific configs.
        
*   If you want eventual GUI automation (keystroke/screen feedback loops), better to script it with **JetBrains Gateway + CLI tools + keystroke simulation** (e.g., AutoHotKey or Win32 SendInput).
    

> **Verdict**: Only build a Rider plugin **if you want to allow human-in-the-loop** GUI editing sessions. For full autonomy, work headless via Roslyn + Git.

* * *

#### **3\. Use `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` as sanity check**

*   After code is modified by TARS:
    
    *   Compile with `dotnet build`.
        
    *   Run `dotnet test` and capture output.
        
*   You can even include mutation testing (e.g., [Stryker.NET](https://stryker-mutator.io)) to evaluate code quality.
    

> **Bonus**: These results can feed into TARS' `.tars` retrospection engine.

* * *

#### **4\. Use a Local LLM + MCP Server (Claude, Ollama, etc.)**

*   Yes, **Claude Desktop + your own MCP server** is a great plan:
    
    *   Claude is great at agentic planning + coding logic.
        
    *   Your **MCP (Mission Control Program)** can orchestrate:
        
        *   Code extraction (current state via Roslyn).
            
        *   Prompt generation.
            
        *   Sending/receiving from Claude or Ollama.
            
        *   Injecting improved code.
            
        *   Triggering validations.
            
        *   Recording diffs and logs.
            

> **Keep the loop file-based and version-controlled** (your idea of `.tars` folders per iteration is spot on).

* * *

#### **5\. Track State and Learning**

*   Use `.tars` metascript to track:
    
    *   Prompt used.
        
    *   Code diff (AST + text).
        
    *   Reasoning steps.
        
    *   Test outcomes.
        
    *   Claude/Ollama’s internal thoughts (if extractable).
        
*   This enables **cumulative learning and error diagnosis** over time.
    

* * *

#### **6\. Optional Enhancements**

*   **Editor embedding (Monaco or Rider Editor)** in a Blazor UI could be used to show diffs and prompt history.
    
*   Add Git integration to allow:
    
    *   Real commits from TARS.
        
    *   Rollbacks.
        
    *   Git diffs in retrospection UI.
        

* * *

### **Summary: The Best Stack to Start the Retroaction Loop**

| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Roslyn** | Syntax tree control, validation, refactoring |
| **dotnet CLI** | Compilation, testing, coverage |
| **Claude/Ollama** | Prompt-based reasoning, refactor generation |
| **Your MCP server** | Orchestration layer for TARS prompts/actions |
| **File-based diffs** | Self-analysis and learning via `.tars` files |
| **Git CLI** | Snapshot/rollback/versioning |

* * *

Would you like a bootstrapped example showing:

*   How Roslyn could find and modify a method?
    
*   How the MCP could orchestrate a Claude prompt and validate the result?
    

This could serve as your **first true retroactive coding loop**.

## Prompt:
The problem is I have no idea where to start (Aside the idea of a TARS running in CLI) to minimize initial human coding without using Augment Code or Cursor

## Response:
Perfect. You're looking to bootstrap **TARS with as little manual code as possible**, starting from a **CLI** and gradually building up toward autonomy, **without depending on third-party IDE copilots** like Augment or Cursor.

Let’s make this _real_. Here's a practical, incremental path to kickstart TARS **from a blank folder** with only a CLI and a local model (e.g. Claude/Ollama) as an assistant.

* * *

**TARS v0.1 – Bootstrapping From CLI**
--------------------------------------

### **Overview**

A lightweight CLI app (`tarscli`) that:

1.  Reads `.cs` source files.
    
2.  Uses Roslyn to analyze them.
    
3.  Sends prompts to a local LLM.
    
4.  Applies the LLM's response to modify the source.
    
5.  Validates with `dotnet build/test`.
    
6.  Records each step into a versioned `output/v0.1/` folder.
    

* * *

### **1\. Setup the Minimal CLI**

Create a new .NET console app:

```bash
dotnet new console -n tarscli
cd tarscli
```

Add NuGet packages:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
```

* * *

### **2\. Define TARS CLI Loop**

In `Program.cs`:

```csharp
using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis;
using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp;
using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Formatting;
using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.MSBuild;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using System.Diagnostics;

string projectPath = args.Length > 0 ? args[0] : @"../SomeProject/SomeProject.csproj";

var workspace = MSBuildWorkspace.Create();
var project = await workspace.OpenProjectAsync(projectPath);
var document = project.Documents.First(); // Start with one file

string code = await document.GetTextAsync().ContinueWith(t => t.Result.ToString());

// Save snapshot
Directory.CreateDirectory("output/v0.1");
File.WriteAllText("output/v0.1/original.cs", code);

// Generate prompt
string prompt = $"Suggest an improvement to this method:\n\n{code}";

// Send to local LLM (placeholder for now)
string llmOutput = await File.ReadAllTextAsync("mock_response.txt"); // Replace with actual Claude/Ollama integration

// Save LLM output
File.WriteAllText("output/v0.1/llm_response.txt", llmOutput);

// Apply change (you can improve this with diff-based insertions later)
File.WriteAllText(document.FilePath, llmOutput);

// Rebuild project
var process = Process.Start(new ProcessStartInfo("dotnet", $"build \"{projectPath}\"")
{
    RedirectStandardOutput = true
});
process.WaitForExit();
string output = await process.StandardOutput.ReadToEndAsync();

File.WriteAllText("output/v0.1/build_result.txt", output);

Console.WriteLine("Done. Check output/v0.1 for logs.");
```

* * *

### **3\. Simulate LLM with a Local File (for Now)**

Until you hook in Claude/Ollama, create a `mock_response.txt` with the modified code.

Later, you'll replace this with real LLM logic via HTTP to:

*   **Ollama** using `http://localhost:11434/api/generate`
    
*   **Claude API** if you self-host or proxy it
    

* * *

### **4\. (Optional) Add a Git Snapshot**

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial version"
```

Use `libgit2sharp` or CLI calls from within TARS to snapshot pre/post-change diffs automatically.

* * *

**Your First Success Criteria**
-------------------------------

TARS v0.1 should:

*   Load a C# file.
    
*   Feed it into a prompt.
    
*   Apply LLM output as a replacement.
    
*   Validate with `dotnet build`.
    
*   Save all this in `output/v0.1`.
    

That’s your **minimal human-in-the-loop coding loop**.

* * *

### **Next Step Ideas**

*   Replace mock file with real LLM call.
    
*   Analyze AST diffs with Roslyn (`SyntaxTree.Compare()`).
    
*   Implement `.tars` file to log every action.
    
*   Add a “rollback” button (restore from original).
    
*   Add a scoring system from test results.
    

* * *

Would you like me to:

*   Write the code that calls Ollama locally and integrates it?
    
*   Generate a real `mock_response.txt` from Claude or GPT as example?
    
*   Create a `.tars` file format schema and output example?
    

Let me know which piece you'd like next, and we’ll bootstrap this together.

## Prompt:
It would be nice to leverage git for last resort rollback mechanism

## Response:
Yes — **leveraging Git for rollback** is a perfect safeguard and fits beautifully into the TARS retroaction loop. Here's how to integrate Git as a **last-resort rollback mechanism** and make TARS feel confident to **modify, test, and recover** automatically.

* * *

**Step-by-Step Git Integration in TARS (CLI)**
----------------------------------------------

### **1\. Initialize a Git Repo if None Exists**

At the beginning of your CLI loop:

```csharp
if (!Directory.Exists(Path.Combine(projectDir, ".git")))
{
    RunGit("init", projectDir);
    RunGit("add .", projectDir);
    RunGit("commit -m \"Initial snapshot before TARS modifications\"", projectDir);
}
```

* * *

### **2\. Before Any Change: Commit the Current State**

Right before applying LLM edits:

```csharp
string commitMsg = $"TARS pre-change snapshot: {DateTime.UtcNow}";
RunGit("add .", projectDir);
RunGit($"commit -m \"{commitMsg}\"", projectDir);
```

You now have a safe rollback point at every iteration.

* * *

### **3\. On Failure: Rollback to Last Good Commit**

If `dotnet build` or `dotnet test` fails:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Build/test failed. Rolling back...");

RunGit("reset --hard HEAD~1", projectDir);
```

* * *

### **4\. Optional: Tag Successful Iterations**

After successful test + commit, you can tag it:

```csharp
RunGit($"tag tars-v{iterationNumber}", projectDir);
```

* * *

### **5\. Git Helper Method**

```csharp
void RunGit(string arguments, string workingDirectory)
{
    var psi = new ProcessStartInfo("git", arguments)
    {
        WorkingDirectory = workingDirectory,
        RedirectStandardOutput = true,
        RedirectStandardError = true,
        CreateNoWindow = true,
        UseShellExecute = false
    };

    using var process = Process.Start(psi);
    process.WaitForExit();

    var output = process.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();
    var error = process.StandardError.ReadToEnd();

    Console.WriteLine($"[GIT] {arguments}\n{output}{error}");
}
```

* * *

**Git-Based Resilience Loop (TARS 0.2)**
----------------------------------------

1.  **Start**: Snapshot pre-state using Git.
    
2.  **Modify**: Apply LLM suggestion.
    
3.  **Validate**: `dotnet build && test`.
    
4.  **If success**: Tag the commit.
    
5.  **If fail**: Auto `git reset --hard`.
    

> This loop gives TARS freedom to "fail fast and recover instantly", with **no human intervention** needed during experimentation.

* * *

### Bonus: Add `.tars` Metadata to Commits

Each commit message could include a `.tars` metadata block in JSON or YAML like:

```text
TARS Iteration 3
---
reasoning: "Improved loop efficiency"
source: "Claude 2.1"
score: 0.89
build_passed: true
tests_passed: 6/6
timestamp: 2025-03-24T02:10Z
```

* * *

Would you like:

*   A full Git-enabled `Program.cs` example?
    
*   A `.tars` metadata schema with builder code?
    
*   A rollback-proof `TarsOrchestrator.cs` class?
    

Let’s build this piece-by-piece!

## Prompt:
I want to start using Ollanta (Optionally with GPU for speed) and the best free coding model that's reasonably fast

## Response:
Great call! Here's how to get started with **Ollama** using **GPU acceleration** and the **best free coding model** available right now:

* * *

**1\. Install Ollama (GPU-enabled)**
------------------------------------

If you haven’t yet:

### **Windows**:

*   Download from: https://ollama.com/download
    
*   It uses your system’s GPU (NVIDIA) if available.
    
*   Check GPU use: `ollama run llama3:instruct` and monitor with Task Manager or `nvidia-smi`.
    

* * *

**2\. Pull a Good Coding Model**
--------------------------------

### **Recommended Free Models:**

| Model | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Code Llama 13B** | Best overall for multi-language coding tasks, including C#, Python, etc. |
| **Deepseek-Coder 6.7B** | Small and fast, surprisingly good at short tasks. |
| **StarCoder2 7B** | Good general coding model with decent reasoning. |

### **Example:**

```bash
ollama pull codellama:13b-code
```

Or, for faster runs:

```bash
ollama pull deepseek-coder:6.7b
```

* * *

**3\. Run the Model (CLI Loop Integration)**
--------------------------------------------

```bash
ollama run codellama:13b-code
```

Or script it:

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "codellama:13b-code",
  "prompt": "Refactor this C# method to improve performance:\n\npublic void Foo() { ... }",
  "stream": false
}'
```

Parse the response in C# using `HttpClient` and inject into your TARS loop.

* * *

**4\. Enable GPU Optimization**
-------------------------------

Ollama uses GPU **by default** on supported systems (NVIDIA on Windows/Linux). To confirm:

*   Open Task Manager → Performance → GPU → check `ollama.exe`.
    
*   You can also check the Ollama logs (`%APPDATA%\Ollama\ollama.log`) or console output.
    

* * *

**5\. Best Strategy for Speed + Quality**
-----------------------------------------

*   Start with **Deepseek-Coder 6.7B** if you want **faster** iterations.
    
*   Move to **Code Llama 13B** if you want **better long refactors**, even if slower.
    
*   You can **experiment per file or task type** (TARS could choose the model per prompt size eventually).
    

* * *

Would you like:

*   A helper C# class to call Ollama and return completions?
    
*   A benchmark comparison between models?
    
*   A TARS prompt template for sending structured tasks to Ollama?
    

Let me know how you want to integrate it!

## Prompt:
![Uploaded image](https://files.oaiusercontent.com/file-EUvsg824FWdtV2yYMxgsKw?se=2025-03-25T01%3A19%3A55Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&rscc=max-age%3D299%2C%20immutable%2C%20private&rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%3Dimage.png&sig=h4LPWnQDBWkI46qaDv3anXD0l%2Bt0DKp0gogo8GsBR88%3D)

## Response:
Nice — you're already running `TarsCli` and doing diagnostics! Here's a quick breakdown of what the image shows and the next action steps:

* * *

✅ **What’s Working:**
---------------------

*   You're successfully running `dotnet run -r project -t diagnostics`.
    
*   **Ollama is reachable** at `http://localhost:11434`.
    
*   **`codellama:13b-code` is set as your default model**.
    
*   `llama3:8b` is available ✔️
    

* * *

❌ **What Needs Attention:**
---------------------------

### 🔴 `all-minilm` Not Available

This likely refers to a missing model, maybe used for embedding/similarity search or reasoning fallback.

**Fix:** If you're not using `all-minilm` right now, just remove it from the required models list temporarily. If you _do_ need it:

```bash
ollama pull all-minilm
```

_(Though this isn’t officially available on Ollama—maybe your config is referencing a placeholder?)_

* * *

### 🔴 Project Root: Not Set

TARS doesn’t know which project to work on.

**Fix:** Make sure you either:

*   Pass a path to a `.csproj` or `.sln` file when running:
    

```bash
dotnet run --project . -- path\to\MyProject.csproj
```

**OR**

*   Modify your `TarsConfig.json` or equivalent to set a default project root path.
    

* * *

### 🔧 Suggested Fix via Script

The CLI helpfully recommends:

```bash
.\TarsCli\Scripts\Install-Prerequisites.ps1
```

Make sure that PowerShell script:

*   Pulls all required Ollama models.
    
*   Verifies `dotnet` SDK.
    
*   Sets a `ProjectRoot` variable in config if not already set.
    

* * *

🔄 Next Steps
-------------

1.  ✅ \[ \] Check your `TarsCliConfig.json` or similar to make sure the project root is defined.
    
2.  ✅ \[ \] Run the `Install-Prerequisites.ps1` to resolve missing model(s).
    
3.  ✅ \[ \] Confirm your working directory when calling `dotnet run` — you may need to `cd` into a folder with a .csproj.
    

* * *

Would you like me to:

*   Review your `Install-Prerequisites.ps1` script?
    
*   Help you write one from scratch?
    
*   Show how to edit your config to set the project root manually?
    

You’re _very close_ to having the full retroaction loop online.
