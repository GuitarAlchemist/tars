# TARS Self-Improvement System

This document provides technical details about the TARS self-improvement system, its architecture, and implementation.

## Architecture Overview

The self-improvement system consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Code Analyzer**: Examines code for potential issues and improvement opportunities
2. **Pattern Recognizer**: Identifies specific patterns that could be improved
3. **Improvement Generator**: Creates proposals for code improvements
4. **Code Transformer**: Applies approved improvements to the codebase
5. **Learning Database**: Records improvements and feedback for future learning

## Implementation Details

### Code Analyzer

The Code Analyzer is implemented in F# and uses a combination of static analysis and LLM-based techniques:

```fsharp
// Simplified example of the analyze function
let analyze (filePath: string) (ollamaEndpoint: string) (model: string) =
    async {
        let! content = File.ReadAllTextAsync(filePath) |> Async.AwaitTask
        let fileType = getFileType filePath
        
        // Generate prompt for analysis
        let prompt = createAnalysisPrompt filePath content fileType
        
        // Call Ollama API with proper JSON escaping
        let escapedPrompt = escapeJsonString prompt
        let! response = callOllamaApi ollamaEndpoint model escapedPrompt
        
        // Parse the response
        return parseAnalysisResponse response
    }
```

### Pattern Recognizer

The Pattern Recognizer identifies common code issues such as:

- Magic numbers (unnamed numeric literals)
- Empty catch blocks
- String concatenation in loops
- Unused variables
- Mutable variables in F# (when immutable alternatives exist)
- Imperative loops in F# (when functional alternatives exist)
- Long methods
- TODO comments

Each pattern has a specific detection algorithm and a corresponding improvement strategy.

### Improvement Generator

The Improvement Generator creates proposals based on the analysis results:

```fsharp
// Simplified example of the improve function
let improve (filePath: string) (ollamaEndpoint: string) (model: string) =
    async {
        let! analysisResult = analyze filePath ollamaEndpoint model
        
        if analysisResult.Issues.Length > 0 then
            // Generate prompt for improvement
            let prompt = createImprovementPrompt filePath analysisResult
            
            // Call Ollama API with proper JSON escaping
            let escapedPrompt = escapeJsonString prompt
            let! response = callOllamaApi ollamaEndpoint model escapedPrompt
            
            // Parse the response and create improvement proposal
            return parseImprovementResponse response filePath
        else
            return None
    }
```

### Code Transformer

The Code Transformer applies the approved improvements to the codebase:

```fsharp
// Simplified example of the apply function
let applyImprovement (proposal: ImprovementProposal) =
    async {
        try
            // Backup the original file
            let backupPath = proposal.FileName + ".bak"
            File.Copy(proposal.FileName, backupPath, true)
            
            // Write the improved content
            do! File.WriteAllTextAsync(proposal.FileName, proposal.ImprovedContent) |> Async.AwaitTask
            
            return true
        with ex ->
            // Restore from backup if failed
            // ...
            return false
    }
```

### Learning Database

The Learning Database records improvements and feedback:

```fsharp
// Simplified example of the recordImprovement function
let recordImprovement (filePath: string) (fileType: string) (proposal: ImprovementProposal) =
    async {
        let event = {
            Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString()
            Timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow
            FilePath = filePath
            FileType = fileType
            ImprovementProposal = Some proposal
            Feedback = None
        }
        
        do! persistEvent event
        return event.Id
    }
```

## CLI Commands

The self-improvement system is accessible through the following CLI commands:

- `self-analyze`: Analyze a file for potential improvements
- `self-propose`: Generate improvement proposals for a file
- `self-rewrite`: Apply improvements to a file
- `self-stats`: Display statistics from the learning database

## First Self-Improvement Iteration

On March 29, 2025, we ran the first self-improvement iteration on a test file with intentional code issues:

### Test Code

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace TestCode
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // This is a test program with some issues to be improved
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
            
            // Issue 1: Magic numbers
            int timeout = 300;
            
            // Issue 2: Inefficient string concatenation in loop
            string result = "";
            for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
            {
                result += i.ToString();
            }
            
            // Issue 3: Empty catch block
            try
            {
                int x = int.Parse("abc");
            }
            catch (Exception)
            {
                // Empty catch block
            }
            
            // Issue 4: Unused variable
            var unusedList = new List<string>();
            
            Console.WriteLine(result);
            Console.WriteLine($"Timeout is set to {timeout} seconds");
        }
    }
}
```

### Analysis Results

The analysis successfully identified the following issues:

- Magic numbers on multiple lines (13, 14, 16, 18, 23, 33)
- Inefficient string concatenation in a loop on line 18

And provided these recommendations:

- Replace magic numbers with named constants
- Use StringBuilder instead of string concatenation in loops

### Next Steps

1. Complete the first full self-improvement iteration
2. Enhance the learning database implementation
3. Add more code patterns to the pattern recognition system
4. Improve the quality of explanations in improvement proposals
5. Create visualizations of the self-improvement process
6. Implement metrics to measure improvement quality

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-file Analysis**: Analyze relationships between files
- **Project-wide Improvements**: Suggest refactorings across multiple files
- **Learning from User Feedback**: Adjust improvement strategies based on user acceptance
- **Language-specific Optimizations**: Tailor improvements to specific programming languages
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure the impact of improvements on code quality and performance
