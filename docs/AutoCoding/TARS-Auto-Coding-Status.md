# TARS Auto-Coding Status

This document provides the current status of the TARS Auto-Coding feature.

## Overview

TARS Auto-Coding is a feature that allows TARS to analyze, improve, and test its own code without human intervention. This feature is implemented using Docker containers, which provide isolation, reproducibility, and scalability.

## Current Status

### Docker Auto-Coding

- **Status**: Implemented
- **Description**: The Docker Auto-Coding approach uses a single Docker container to improve code. This approach is simpler and easier to set up, but it doesn't provide the same level of isolation and scalability as the Swarm Auto-Coding approach.
- **Scripts**:
  - `Run-AutoCoding.ps1`: Finds TODOs in the codebase and improves them.
  - `Run-AutoCoding-Simple.ps1`: A simple script that demonstrates auto-coding by improving a test file.
  - `Run-AutoCoding-Real.ps1`: A more advanced script that finds TODOs in the codebase and improves them with real implementations.
  - `Test-AutoCoding.ps1`: Tests the auto-coding capabilities.
  - `Test-AutoCodingDocker.ps1`: Tests the auto-coding capabilities using Docker.
- **Documentation**: [Docker Auto-Coding Documentation](Docker/README-Docker-Auto-Coding-Final.md)

### Swarm Auto-Coding

- **Status**: Implemented
- **Description**: The Swarm Auto-Coding approach uses a swarm of specialized Docker containers to analyze, improve, and test code. This approach provides better isolation, reproducibility, and scalability, but it's more complex to set up and manage.
- **Scripts**:
  - `Run-SwarmAutoCode.ps1`: Manages the swarm and synchronizes files between Docker and the host.
  - `Run-TarsAutoCodeSwarm.ps1`: Orchestrates the entire swarm auto-coding process.
  - `Apply-SwarmImprovements.ps1`: Applies the improvements to the host with backup and rollback capabilities.
  - `Test-SwarmImprovements.ps1`: Tests the improvements in Docker.
- **Documentation**: [Swarm Auto-Coding Documentation](Swarm/README-Swarm-Auto-Coding-Final.md)

### TARS CLI Integration

- **Status**: Planned
- **Description**: The TARS CLI will provide commands for auto-coding, such as `auto-code --docker` and `auto-code --swarm`.
- **Scripts**: None yet
- **Documentation**: None yet

### Demo Scripts

- **Status**: Implemented
- **Description**: Demo scripts that showcase the auto-coding capabilities of TARS.
- **Scripts**:
  - `Demo-AutoCoding.ps1`: A PowerShell Core script that showcases TARS Auto-Coding capabilities.
  - `Run-SwarmAutoCode-Test.ps1`: Tests the swarm auto-coding process with a simple example.
  - `Test-SwarmAutoCode-Simple.ps1`: A simple script that demonstrates swarm auto-coding.
- **Documentation**: [Auto-Coding Demos](../../Scripts/AutoCoding/Demos/README.md)

## Next Steps

1. **Implement TARS CLI Integration**: Add commands to the TARS CLI for auto-coding.
2. **Improve Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling to the auto-coding process.
3. **Add Metrics and Monitoring**: Add metrics and monitoring to track the performance of the auto-coding process.
4. **Integrate with CI/CD**: Integrate the auto-coding process with CI/CD pipelines.
5. **Add Support for More Languages**: Extend the auto-coding process to support more programming languages.

## Conclusion

TARS Auto-Coding is a powerful feature that enables TARS to improve itself without human intervention. By using Docker containers, TARS can analyze, improve, and test its own code in a safe and reproducible way.

The Docker Auto-Coding approach provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for auto-coding, while the Swarm Auto-Coding approach provides a more advanced and scalable interface. Both approaches have been implemented and tested, and they are ready for use.

The next steps are to implement the TARS CLI integration, improve error handling, add metrics and monitoring, integrate with CI/CD pipelines, and add support for more programming languages. These improvements will make the auto-coding feature even more powerful and useful.
