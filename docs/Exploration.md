# TARS Code Analysis and Improvement System

## Example: Auto-Refactoring Based on Git Commits
Instead of hardcoding improvements, TARS can analyze its own Git history.

```fsharp
type GitHubProvider = FSharp.Data.GitHubProvider<"https://github.com/spareilleux/TARS">

let latestCommit = GitHubProvider.Repository("TARS").Commits |> Seq.head
printfn "Last Commit: %s" latestCommit.Commit.Message
```

### Why This is Useful
- Detects past patterns of code evolution
- AI can predict necessary optimizations

## Adaptive AI Code Generation
F# Type Providers allow TARS to adapt dynamically to AI-generated rules.

### Example: Auto-Generating Database Queries
Instead of manually defining database queries, TARS can generate them dynamically.

```fsharp
type Db = SqlDataProvider<Common.DatabaseProviderTypes.POSTGRESQL, "Host=localhost;Database=TARS_DB;Username=postgres;Password=secret">
let ctx = Db.GetDataContext()

let agents = ctx.Public.Agents |> Seq.map (fun agent -> agent.Name) |> Seq.toList
printfn "Active Agents: %A" agents
```

### Why This is Useful
- Dynamic query generation based on AI analysis
- Real-time database schema adaptation

## üõ†Ô∏è Features of the Prototype
- ‚úÖ Hot Code Reloading ‚Üí Loads AI-generated improvements without restarting
- ‚úÖ Blue/Green Deployment ‚Üí Runs a "Green" test version before replacing the "Blue" stable version
- ‚úÖ AI-Driven Adaptation ‚Üí Dynamically fetches new agents, configurations, and optimizations from a remote source
- ‚úÖ Self-Rollback ‚Üí If the "Green" version fails, TARS keeps running the "Blue" version
