## Prompt:
Is onnx faster than Ollama?

## Response:
The comparison between **ONNX Runtime** and **Ollama** depends heavily on what you're doing, but here's a quick breakdown:

* * *

### **1\. What is ONNX Runtime?**

ONNX Runtime is a **high-performance inference engine** for ML models in the ONNX format. It’s **optimized for speed and efficiency**, especially when running models locally using **CUDA, DirectML, or CPU backends**.

*   **Use case:** Running models like image classifiers, object detectors, and small/medium LLMs.
    
*   **Speed:** Extremely fast for supported models, especially with GPU (CUDA, TensorRT).
    
*   **Footprint:** Low memory and fast startup.
    

* * *

### **2\. What is Ollama?**

Ollama is a **runtime and model manager for large language models (LLMs)** like LLaMA, Mistral, Gemma, etc. It abstracts away a lot of complexity and makes it easy to run chatbots and generative AI on your machine.

*   **Use case:** Running full-blown chat-style LLMs.
    
*   **Speed:** Depends on the model size (e.g. Mistral 7B, LLaMA 13B) and your hardware.
    
*   **Footprint:** Can be heavy due to large model sizes and memory use.
    

* * *

### **Performance Comparison (Generalized):**

| Feature | ONNX Runtime | Ollama (LLM Engine) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Startup Time** | Very fast | Slower (model has to load into RAM) |
| **Latency** | Low (milliseconds) | Higher (hundreds of ms – seconds) |
| **Throughput** | High (batch inference supported) | Lower (optimized for chat completion) |
| **Hardware Utilization** | Highly optimized (CPU/GPU) | Optimized for LLMs with quantization |
| **Model Size** | Small to medium | Medium to very large (7B–70B) |

* * *

### TL;DR:

*   **ONNX Runtime is faster for inference of small-to-medium models** (especially if you're using CUDA).
    
*   **Ollama is better for LLMs** and natural language interaction, but it's **slower** due to model size and complexity.
    

* * *

If you're just looking for raw speed and you can convert your model to ONNX, **ONNX Runtime will be faster**. If you're working with full LLMs, Ollama is more convenient but generally slower.

Let me know your use case and I can give a more precise comparison.
