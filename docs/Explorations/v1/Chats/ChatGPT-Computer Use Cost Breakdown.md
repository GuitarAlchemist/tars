## Prompt:
Is this free https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/computer-use

## Response:
​No, Anthropic's "computer use" feature is not free; it incurs costs based on the number of tokens processed during usage. For the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, the pricing is $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens. Additionally, utilizing the "computer use" feature requires a special system prompt, which adds approximately 466 to 499 tokens per request. This means that each interaction with the "computer use" feature will include these additional tokens, contributing to the overall cost. ​[support.anthropic.com+5tech.co+5theverge.com+5](https://tech.co/news/how-much-does-claude-ai-cost)[docs.anthropic.com+11datacamp.com+11theverge.com+11](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/what-is-anthropic-computer-use)

It's important to note that API and Workbench usage are billed via prepaid "usage credits," which must be purchased prior to using the API. These credits are applied to your usage according to Anthropic's current pricing, and failed requests are not charged; you are only billed for successful API calls and completed tasks. ​[support.anthropic.com+1tech.co+1](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8977456-how-do-i-pay-for-my-api-usage)

In practical terms, users have reported that tasks involving "computer use" can accumulate costs relatively quickly. For example, one user noted that a sequence of tests cost around $2 in API usage credits. Therefore, while the feature offers advanced capabilities, it's essential to monitor token usage to manage expenses effectively.​[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1gat8i7/computer_use_is_extremely_expensive_right/)[ui.vision](https://ui.vision/blog/computer-use/)

## Prompt:
Is there a free alternative?

## Response:
​Yes, there are free alternatives to Anthropic's "computer use" feature that allow AI models to interact with computer interfaces:​

**1\. Open Interface**

Open Interface is an open-source project designed to enable AI models to perform tasks on computers by simulating user interactions such as moving the cursor, clicking buttons, and typing text. This tool allows developers to automate workflows and integrate AI capabilities into various applications without incurring additional costs. ​[anthropic.com](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use)

**2\. OS-ATLAS**

OS-ATLAS is another open-source initiative aimed at facilitating GUI-based agents to execute tasks on computers by leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It serves as a foundational action model, enabling AI systems to understand and interact with graphical user interfaces effectively. ​[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/areganti_os-atlas-looks-like-a-great-open-source-activity-7260289920630415360-UxVi)

Both of these alternatives provide cost-effective solutions for integrating AI with computer interfaces, offering functionalities similar to Anthropic's "computer use" feature without the associated expenses.​

## Prompt:
Is there something I can integrate with .net core?

## Response:
​Integrating AI-driven computer interaction features into a .NET Core application can be achieved through several approaches:​

**1\. Open Web Interface for .NET (OWIN):**

OWIN is a standardized interface that decouples web applications from web servers, facilitating the integration of various middleware components. ASP.NET Core supports OWIN, allowing developers to incorporate OWIN-based components seamlessly into their applications. ​[de.wikipedia.org+3dev.to+3en.wikipedia.org+3](https://dev.to/rasulhsn/behind-the-scenes-of-owin-open-web-interface-for-net-523d)[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/owin?view=aspnetcore-9.0)

**2\. Dependency Injection (DI):**

ASP.NET Core's built-in support for dependency injection enables the integration of various services, including those facilitating AI-driven functionalities. By defining service interfaces and their implementations, developers can register these services with the DI container and inject them into controllers or other components as needed. ​[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-9.0)[medium.com](https://medium.com/%40ravipatel.it/dependency-injection-and-services-in-asp-net-core-a-comprehensive-guide-dd69858c1eab)

**3\. Refit Library:**

Refit is a library for ASP.NET Core that simplifies HTTP API integrations by allowing developers to define REST API interfaces as C# interfaces. This approach streamlines the process of integrating external services, including AI-based APIs, into .NET Core applications. ​[telerik.com](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/aspnet-core-basics-simplifying-api-integration-refit)

**4\. Quartz.NET:**

For scheduling and executing background tasks, Quartz.NET offers robust support, including integration with ASP.NET Core. This can be particularly useful for running AI-driven tasks at specified intervals or under certain conditions within a .NET Core application. ​

By leveraging these tools and frameworks, you can effectively integrate AI-driven computer interaction capabilities into your .NET Core applications, tailoring the solution to your specific requirements and the nature of the AI functionalities you intend to implement.​
