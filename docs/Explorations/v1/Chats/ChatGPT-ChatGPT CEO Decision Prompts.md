## Prompt:
This sounds BS, can we elaborate?

## Response:
Absolutely. Let's expand and rephrase these prompts to make them more concrete, insightful, and actionable, rather than generic:

### 1\. Original: "What would \[Top CEO you admire\] do in this situation?"

**Improved Prompt:**

> "Imagine you're \[CEO you respect, e.g., Satya Nadella or Tim Cook\]. Given the current scenario, clearly outline your next steps, the reasons behind each step, anticipated challenges, and how you'll mitigate them."

* * *

2.  **Original**: "What are the positive and negative outcomes?"
    

**Improved**:

> "Clearly outline the three most beneficial outcomes and three biggest risks of this decision. For each benefit or risk, specify who it directly impacts, quantify its potential magnitude, and suggest concrete actions to maximize benefits and minimize risks."

* * *

3.  **Original**: "Does this align with our long-term goals?"
    

**Improved**:

> "Assess this decision against our core long-term goals by explicitly stating how it supports or contradicts each major strategic objective. If there's misalignment, explain if and how the immediate benefits outweigh long-term trade-offs."

* * *

3.  **Original**: "What would a CEO do?"
    

**Improved**:

> "Adopting a CEO's mindset—who must balance stakeholders, shareholders, employees, and customers—detail your decision-making process. Address how you prioritize competing interests, resources allocation, immediate versus future impacts, and justify the ultimate choice clearly."

* * *

4.  **Original**: "What does the future hold?"
    

**Improved**:

> "Project the impact of this decision one year and five years from now. What will change within your business, team dynamics, customer perception, market position, and personal role? Provide realistic best-case and worst-case scenarios, and outline what steps you'll take to steer the outcome positively."

* * *

5.  **Original**: "What data or insight are you missing?"
    

**Improved**:

> "Explicitly list what critical data, insights, or expertise you currently lack to make a fully informed decision. Detail how you intend to acquire that information, how long it will take, and what steps you’ll follow if obtaining complete data isn't feasible."

* * *

By turning vague prompts into explicit, actionable tasks, you transform decision-making from generic reflection into practical, actionable steps.
