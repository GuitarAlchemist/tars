## Prompt:
Please break this down so Augment code can process it

Create a LearningPlanService for generating personalized learning plans
Implement a CourseGenerator for structured course content
Add a TutorialOrganizer for managing and categorizing tutorials
Add CLI commands for generating and managing learning content
Implement storage and retrieval of learning plans
Add unit tests for the learning plan generation logic

## Response:
Here's the breakdown of your tasks into clearly defined items suitable for Augment Code processing:

1.  **Create `LearningPlanService`**
    
    *   Responsible for generating personalized learning plans.
        
    *   Should accept user preferences, skill levels, and goals.
        
    *   Outputs structured learning plans tailored for individual learners.
        
2.  **Implement `CourseGenerator`**
    
    *   Generates structured course content.
        
    *   Accepts topics and difficulty levels as inputs.
        
    *   Outputs modular courses with lessons, quizzes, and exercises.
        
3.  **Add `TutorialOrganizer`**
    
    *   Manages and categorizes tutorial content.
        
    *   Supports grouping tutorials by topic, difficulty, and prerequisites.
        
    *   Provides functionality for easy retrieval and filtering.
        
4.  **Add CLI Commands**
    
    *   Create CLI commands for:
        
        *   Generating personalized learning plans (`generate-plan`).
            
        *   Creating structured courses (`create-course`).
            
        *   Managing tutorials (`add-tutorial`, `list-tutorials`, `categorize-tutorials`).
            
5.  **Implement Storage and Retrieval for Learning Plans**
    
    *   Add functionality for persistent storage (database or file-based).
        
    *   Enable retrieval and updating of existing learning plans.
        
6.  **Add Unit Tests**
    
    *   Write unit tests specifically for learning plan generation logic.
        
    *   Ensure tests cover edge cases (e.g., missing user preferences, varying skill levels).
        
    *   Validate the correctness and robustness of generated learning plans.
        

Each task should be implemented and reviewed separately, facilitating incremental development and testing.
