User: I'd like to explore the generalization of the concept of compilation in a context of the hybrid TARS DSL (Hybrid of AI prompts and more formal programming languages) I'd like something like an incubation phase where research from a prompt can be executed, implemented as a new TARS or F# source code, unit and integration tested, evaluated as functionally pure or not, marked with a QA stamp, then integrated in the larger TARS engine - maybe have post-integration tests
Assistant: [Detailed breakdown of the incubation system, including research phase, sandbox execution, prototyping, testing, and integration, ensuring non-degradation through regression testing.]

User: I think this incubation system should be able to produce pre-incubation assumptions that can be assessed at each phase of the incubation. Similarly, an incubation should not degrade the existing system (Regression testing).
Assistant: [Enhancements incorporating pre-incubation assumptions, regression testing, iterative assessments at each phase, and automated rollbacks to safeguard stability.]

User: Try to flesh out Spikes and Epics from your results of the exploration.
Assistant: [Comprehensive breakdown of Epics and Spikes, outlining tasks such as assumption validation, automated testing, CI/CD integration, regression testing, metadata tracking, and performance monitoring.]
