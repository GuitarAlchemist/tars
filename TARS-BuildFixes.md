# TARS Build Fix Plan

## Approach

1. Focus on fixing one project at a time, starting with TarsEngine
2. Within each project, focus on fixing the most critical errors first
3. Use a combination of:
   - Creating adapter/extension classes
   - Fixing type conflicts
   - Adding missing properties
   - Resolving namespace issues

## TarsEngine Project Fixes

### Phase 1: Fix Core Type Conflicts

1. Create a CodeAnalysisResultAdapter class to handle missing properties
2. Create a ComplexityTypeConverter to handle type conflicts
3. Create a TestExecutionResultAdapter to handle missing properties
4. Fix the Insight namespace/class conflict

### Phase 2: Fix Method Signature Mismatches

1. Create LogLevelConverter to convert between different LogLevel types
2. Fix dictionary initialization issues in ImprovementGenerationOrchestrator

### Phase 3: Fix Nullable Reference Issues

1. Add null checks where needed
2. Initialize non-nullable properties

## TarsApp Project Fixes

1. Add missing type arguments to MudChip, MudList, and other components
2. Fix namespace references to TarsEngine

## Implementation Plan

1. Start by creating adapter classes for the most critical types
2. Fix one file at a time, starting with the most referenced files
3. Test incrementally by building after each major fix
