# Autonomous Improvement of TARS Documentation and Codebase

This document explains the autonomous improvement process for TARS documentation and codebase using metascripts and the collaboration between Augment Code and TARS CLI in MCP mode.

## Overview

The autonomous improvement process leverages the knowledge in the TARS exploration files to improve the codebase. It consists of the following steps:

1. Extract knowledge from exploration files
2. Generate a knowledge report
3. Apply knowledge to improve code files
4. Generate a retroaction report
5. Run TARS self-improvement

## Prerequisites

1. TARS CLI installed and configured
2. Node.js installed
3. Augment Code integration with TARS configured

## Running the Autonomous Improvement Process

To run the autonomous improvement process, simply execute the batch script:

```
run-autonomous-improvement.cmd
```

This will:

1. Register the autonomous improvement metascript with TARS
2. Start the TARS MCP service
3. Run the collaborative improvement script
4. Run the TARS metascript for autonomous improvement
5. Stop the TARS MCP service when done

## Components

### 1. Collaborative Improvement Script

The `augment-tars-collaborative-improvement.js` script coordinates the collaboration between Augment Code and TARS. It:

- Extracts knowledge from exploration files
- Generates a knowledge report
- Applies knowledge to improve code files
- Generates retroaction reports
- Starts TARS self-improvement

### 2. Autonomous Improvement Metascript

The `autonomous_improvement.tars` metascript is executed by TARS to perform autonomous improvement. It:

- Extracts knowledge from exploration files
- Generates a knowledge report
- Applies knowledge to improve code files
- Generates a summary report

### 3. Configuration Files

- `autonomous-improvement-config.json`: Configuration for the autonomous improvement process
- `augment-tars-config.json`: Configuration for Augment Code integration with TARS

### 4. Helper Scripts

- `register-metascript.ps1`: Registers the metascript with TARS
- `run-collaborative-improvement.ps1`: Runs the collaborative improvement process
- `run-autonomous-improvement.ps1`: Runs the entire autonomous improvement process

## Exploration Directories

The autonomous improvement process targets the following exploration directories:

- `C:/Users/spare/source/repos/tars/docs/Explorations/v1/Chats`
- `C:/Users/spare/source/repos/tars/docs/Explorations/Reflections`

## Target Directories

The autonomous improvement process applies knowledge to improve the following directories:

- `C:/Users/spare/source/repos/tars/TarsCli/Services`
- `C:/Users/spare/source/repos/tars/TarsCli/Commands`
- `C:/Users/spare/source/repos/tars/TarsCli/Models`

## Reports

The autonomous improvement process generates the following reports:

- Knowledge Report: A summary of the knowledge extracted from exploration files
- Retroaction Report: An analysis of how effectively knowledge was applied
- Autonomous Improvement Report: A summary of the autonomous improvement process

## Logs

The autonomous improvement process logs its progress to:

- `collaborative-improvement-log.md`: Log of the collaborative improvement process
- TARS CLI logs: Log of the TARS metascript execution

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the autonomous improvement process:

1. Check the logs for error messages
2. Ensure TARS CLI is properly installed and configured
3. Ensure Node.js is properly installed
4. Ensure the TARS MCP service is running
5. Check the file paths in the configuration files
