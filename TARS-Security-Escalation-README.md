# 🛡️ TARS Security Escalation to DevSecOps Agent

**Comprehensive Security Incident Detection, Classification, and Autonomous DevSecOps Response**

## 🎯 Overview

TARS now includes an advanced security escalation system that automatically detects security incidents, classifies them by severity, and escalates them appropriately to the DevSecOps agent for autonomous response. This ensures that security issues are handled promptly and effectively without human intervention.

### Key Features

- **🔍 Real-time Security Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of authentication attempts, access patterns, and suspicious activities
- **🚨 Intelligent Incident Classification**: Automatic severity assessment and incident type classification
- **⚡ Autonomous DevSecOps Response**: Immediate automated response with appropriate mitigation actions
- **📊 Pattern Analysis**: Detection of brute force attacks, token tampering, and suspicious behavior patterns
- **🔄 Escalation Management**: Configurable escalation thresholds and timeout handling
- **📝 Comprehensive Audit Trail**: Detailed logging and incident tracking for forensic analysis

### Component Responsibilities

#### **1. JWT Middleware** (`SimpleJwtAuth.fs`)
- Validates JWT tokens and monitors authentication attempts
- Detects failed authentication patterns and suspicious activities
- Implements IP-based lockouts for brute force protection
- Reports security incidents to the escalation manager

#### **2. Security Escalation Manager** (`SecurityEscalationManager.fs`)
- Receives and classifies security incidents by type and severity
- Analyzes patterns to detect coordinated attacks
- Manages escalation thresholds and timeout handling
- Coordinates with DevSecOps agent for incident response

#### **3. DevSecOps Agent** (`DevSecOpsAgent.fs`)
- Provides autonomous security incident response
- Generates recommendations and automated mitigation actions
- Handles human escalation for critical incidents
- Maintains incident response history and metrics

## 🚨 Security Incident Types

### Incident Classification

| Type | Description | Typical Severity | Auto-Response |
|------|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| **AuthenticationFailure** | Failed login attempts | Low-Medium | Monitor, lockout after threshold |
| **BruteForceAttack** | Multiple failed attempts from same IP | High | IP blocking, rate limiting |
| **TokenTampering** | Invalid JWT signatures or malformed tokens | High | Token invalidation, key rotation |
| **UnauthorizedAccess** | Access attempts to protected resources | Medium | Access review, monitoring |
| **SuspiciousActivity** | Automated tools, scanners, unusual patterns | Medium | Behavioral analysis, blocking |
| **SystemCompromise** | Critical system errors or security breaches | Critical | Immediate containment, human escalation |

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Escalation Threshold | Response Time | Actions |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|---------|
| **Low** | 20 incidents | 4 hours | Monitoring, logging |
| **Medium** | 10 incidents | 1 hour | Enhanced monitoring, alerts |
| **High** | 3 incidents | 15 minutes | Automated mitigation, blocking |
| **Critical** | 1 incident | 5 minutes | Immediate response, human escalation |
