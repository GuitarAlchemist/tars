## 7. DETAILED MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS

### 7.1 Neuromorphic Computing Models

#### Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neuron Model
```
Membrane Dynamics:
τ_m × dV/dt = -(V(t) - V_rest) + R_m × I(t)

Where:
- τ_m = membrane time constant (10-20 ms)
- V(t) = membrane potential at time t
- V_rest = resting potential (-70 mV)
- R_m = membrane resistance (10-100 MΩ)
- I(t) = input current

Spike Generation:
if V(t) ≥ V_threshold then
    Spike_Emitted = true
    V(t) = V_reset
    Refractory_Period = τ_ref
```

#### Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP)
```
Synaptic Weight Update:
ΔW = A_+ × exp(-Δt/τ_+) for LTP (Δt > 0)
ΔW = -A_- × exp(Δt/τ_-) for LTD (Δt < 0)

Where:
- Δt = t_post - t_pre (spike timing difference)
- A_+ = 0.01 (LTP amplitude)
- A_- = 0.012 (LTD amplitude)
- τ_+ = 20 ms (LTP time constant)
- τ_- = 20 ms (LTD time constant)
```

### 7.2 Optical Computing Mathematical Framework

#### Coherent Light Interference
```
Interference Pattern:
I_total = |E₁ + E₂|² = |E₁|² + |E₂|² + 2|E₁||E₂|cos(φ₂ - φ₁)

Phase Encoding:
φ = 2π × Optical_Path_Difference / λ

Where:
- λ = 1550 nm (telecom wavelength)
- Optical_Path_Difference = n × L (refractive index × length)
- n = 1.45 (typical fiber refractive index)
```

#### Optical Matrix Multiplication
```
Matrix_Element_Computation:
Result[i,j] = Σₖ Input[i,k] × Weight[k,j] × cos(φ[k])

Computation_Speed:
Processing_Rate = c / (n × optical_path_length)
Theoretical_Max = 2×10⁸ m/s / (1.45 × 0.001 m) = 1.38×10¹¹ operations/second
```

### 7.3 Quantum Computing Simulation Models

#### Quantum State Representation
```
Quantum_State: |ψ⟩ = Σᵢ αᵢ|i⟩ where Σᵢ |αᵢ|² = 1

Multi-Qubit State:
|ψ⟩ = α₀₀|00⟩ + α₀₁|01⟩ + α₁₀|10⟩ + α₁₁|11⟩

Normalization Constraint:
|α₀₀|² + |α₀₁|² + |α₁₀|² + |α₁₁|² = 1
```

#### Quantum Gate Operations
```
Pauli-X Gate: X = [0 1; 1 0]
Pauli-Y Gate: Y = [0 -i; i 0]
Pauli-Z Gate: Z = [1 0; 0 -1]
Hadamard Gate: H = (1/√2)[1 1; 1 -1]

CNOT Gate: CNOT = [1 0 0 0; 0 1 0 0; 0 0 0 1; 0 0 1 0]
```

#### Quantum Measurement
```
Measurement Probability:
P(outcome_i) = |⟨i|ψ⟩|²

State Collapse:
|ψ⟩ → |i⟩ with probability P(outcome_i)
```

### 7.4 CUDA Performance Optimization Models

#### GPU Memory Bandwidth Utilization
```
Theoretical_Bandwidth = Memory_Clock × Bus_Width × 2 (DDR)
Effective_Bandwidth = Theoretical_Bandwidth × Efficiency_Factor

For RTX 4090:
Theoretical_Bandwidth = 21 Gbps × 384-bit × 2 = 1008 GB/s
Typical_Efficiency = 80-90%
Effective_Bandwidth ≈ 800-900 GB/s
```

#### Parallel Processing Speedup
```
Amdahl's Law:
Speedup = 1 / (S + (1-S)/N)

Where:
- S = sequential fraction of code
- N = number of parallel processors
- (1-S) = parallelizable fraction

For TARS CUDA operations:
S ≈ 0.05 (5% sequential overhead)
N = 10,752 CUDA cores (RTX 4090)
Theoretical_Speedup ≈ 19.6x
```
