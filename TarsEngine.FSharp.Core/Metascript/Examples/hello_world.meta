# Hello World Metascript

This is a simple example metascript that demonstrates the basic functionality.

```yaml
name: Hello World
description: A simple example metascript
author: TARS
version: 1.0.0
```

## Text Block

This is a text block. It doesn't execute any code, it just outputs its content.

## F# Block

```fsharp
// This is an F# code block
let greeting = "Hello, World!"
printfn "%s" greeting

// Define a function
let add x y = x + y
let result = add 2 3
printfn "2 + 3 = %d" result

// Return a value
result
```

## Command Block

```command
echo "Hello from the command line!"
```

## Multiple F# Blocks

```fsharp
// This block uses the result from the previous F# block
let newResult = result * 2
printfn "Result * 2 = %d" newResult
```

```fsharp
// This block defines a more complex function
let fibonacci n =
    let rec fib n a b =
        match n with
        | 0 -> a
        | _ -> fib (n - 1) b (a + b)
    fib n 0 1

// Calculate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
[0..9] |> List.map fibonacci |> printfn "Fibonacci numbers: %A"
```

## Conclusion

This metascript demonstrates the basic functionality of the metascript system, including:

1. Text blocks
2. F# code blocks
3. Command blocks
4. Variable sharing between blocks

You can use this as a starting point for creating your own metascripts.
