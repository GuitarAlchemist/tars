# F# Code Analysis Implementation

This directory contains the F# implementation of the TARS engine code analysis services. The implementation is designed to replace the C# implementation while maintaining compatibility with existing code.

## Components

### Types.fs

This file defines the F# types for code analysis:

- `IssueSeverity`: Represents the severity of a code issue
- `CodeIssueType`: Represents the type of a code issue
- `CodeIssue`: Represents a code issue detected during analysis
- `CodeStructure`: Represents a code structure extracted from source code
- `PatternMatch`: Represents a pattern match found in code
- `CodePattern`: Represents a code pattern
- `CodeAnalysisResult`: Represents the result of a code analysis
- `ReadabilityMetric`: Represents a readability metric
- `ComplexityMetric`: Represents a complexity metric
- `MaintainabilityMetric`: Represents a maintainability metric
- `HalsteadMetric`: Represents a Halstead complexity metric
- `ReadabilityType`: Represents the type of readability to analyze

### Interfaces.fs

This file defines the F# interfaces for code analysis:

- `ILanguageAnalyzer`: Interface for language-specific code analyzers
- `ICodeStructureExtractor`: Interface for extracting code structures from source code
- `IIssueDetector`: Interface for detecting code issues
- `ISecurityIssueDetector`: Interface for detecting security issues in code
- `IPerformanceIssueDetector`: Interface for detecting performance issues in code
- `IComplexityIssueDetector`: Interface for detecting complexity issues in code
- `IStyleIssueDetector`: Interface for detecting style issues in code
- `ICodeAnalyzerService`: Interface for the code analyzer service
- `IPatternMatcherService`: Interface for the pattern matcher service
- `ICodeComplexityAnalyzer`: Interface for code complexity analyzer
- `IReadabilityAnalyzer`: Interface for readability analyzer
- `IProgressReporter`: Interface for progress reporter

## Usage

### Using the Code Analyzer Service

```fsharp
// Create a code analyzer service
let codeAnalyzerService = ... // Get from dependency injection

// Analyze a file
let result = codeAnalyzerService.AnalyzeFileAsync("path/to/file.cs").Result

// Check the result
if result.Issues.IsEmpty then
    printfn "No issues found"
else
    for issue in result.Issues do
        printfn "Issue: %s (%A)" issue.Message issue.IssueType
```

### Using the Pattern Matcher Service

```fsharp
// Create a pattern matcher service
let patternMatcherService = ... // Get from dependency injection

// Find patterns in code
let patterns = patternMatcherService.FindPatternsAsync(code, "csharp").Result

// Check the patterns
for pattern in patterns do
    printfn "Pattern: %s (%f)" pattern.PatternName pattern.Confidence
```

### Using the Code Complexity Analyzer

```fsharp
// Create a code complexity analyzer
let complexityAnalyzer = ... // Get from dependency injection

// Analyze complexity of a file
let metrics = complexityAnalyzer.AnalyzeCyclomaticComplexityAsync("path/to/file.cs", "csharp").Result

// Check the metrics
for metric in metrics do
    printfn "Metric: %s (%f)" metric.Name metric.Value
```

## Benefits of the F# Implementation

1. **Type Safety**: The F# implementation uses F# types and pattern matching for better type safety.
2. **Functional Approach**: The implementation uses a functional approach with immutable types and pure functions.
3. **Compatibility**: The implementation maintains compatibility with existing C# code.
4. **Performance**: The F# implementation is optimized for performance.
5. **Maintainability**: The F# implementation is more concise and easier to maintain.

## Future Improvements

1. **Incremental Analysis**: Add support for incremental analysis to improve performance.
2. **Parallel Analysis**: Add support for parallel analysis to improve performance.
3. **Machine Learning**: Add support for machine learning-based code analysis.
4. **Custom Rules**: Add support for custom analysis rules.
5. **Integration with IDEs**: Add support for integration with IDEs for better development experience.
