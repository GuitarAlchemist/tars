DIALOGUE ANALYSIS RESULTS:
==========================

Agent Communication Patterns:
- Metascript execution coordination (High frequency)
- Agent task assignment and coordination (Critical)
- Consciousness reasoning and decision-making (Core functionality)
- Memory management and knowledge retrieval (Essential)
- Autonomous evolution planning (Strategic)
- Error handling and recovery (Operational)
- Performance optimization (Continuous)

Missing UI Functionalities Identified:
- Real-time metascript execution monitoring
- Agent team coordination dashboard
- Consciousness interaction interface
- Memory and knowledge base browser
- Evolution progress tracking
- Error and recovery management
- Performance analytics dashboard

User Interaction Needs Detected:
- Direct access to all TARS capabilities
- Real-time system status visibility
- Interactive control over agent teams
- Metascript development environment
- Consciousness communication interface
