# Real Metascript Execution Implementation

## Current Status
✅ CLI Framework: Working
✅ Intelligence: Real AI analysis  
✅ ML: Real ML operations
✅ Metascript Discovery: 124 metascripts found
❌ Metascript Execution: Still simulated

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Real FSHARP Block Execution
- Connect metascript FSHARP blocks to F# compiler
- Enable real F# code execution within metascripts
- Support variable interpolation

### Phase 2: Real ACTION Block Execution  
- Enable real file operations
- Support system commands
- Implement logging and output generation

### Phase 3: Real VARIABLE Interpolation
- Implement \ substitution
- Support dynamic variable resolution
- Enable cross-block variable sharing

## Demo: What Real Execution Would Look Like

When we run: tars exec hello_world

Real execution would:
1. Parse the metascript file
2. Execute FSHARP blocks with real F# compiler
3. Perform real ACTION operations (file I/O, etc.)
4. Generate real output in .tars folders
5. Return actual execution results

## Next Steps
1. Modify MetascriptExecutor to use real execution engine
2. Connect to TarsEngineFSharp\MetascriptExecutionEngine.fs
3. Test with simple metascripts
4. Expand to complex autonomous improvement workflows
