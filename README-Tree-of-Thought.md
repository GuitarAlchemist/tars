# Tree-of-Thought Implementation

This is a simplified implementation of the Tree-of-Thought reasoning approach for code analysis, fix generation, and fix application.

## Overview

The Tree-of-Thought approach is a reasoning technique that explores multiple solution paths simultaneously, evaluates them, and selects the most promising ones. This implementation demonstrates how to use Tree-of-Thought reasoning for:

1. **Code Analysis**: Analyzing code to identify issues and improvement opportunities
2. **Fix Generation**: Generating fixes for identified issues
3. **Fix Application**: Applying the generated fixes to the code

## Components

The implementation consists of the following components:

1. **F# Tree-of-Thought Module**: The core implementation of the Tree-of-Thought reasoning in F#
2. **C# Wrapper Service**: A C# service that wraps the F# implementation and provides a simple API
3. **CLI Command**: A command-line interface for testing the Tree-of-Thought reasoning

## Prerequisites

- .NET 6.0 or later
- F# compiler (included with .NET SDK)

## Getting Started

### 1. Build the Project

```bash
dotnet build
```

### 2. Run the Simple Tree-of-Thought Test

```bash
./run_simple_tot_test.ps1
```

This script will:
1. Create the necessary directories
2. Run the Tree-of-Thought analysis on a sample code file
3. Generate fixes for the identified issues
4. Apply the fixes to the code

### 3. Examine the Results

The results will be saved in the `tot_results` directory:
- `SampleCode_analyze_result.json`: The analysis result
- `SampleCode_analyze_best_approach.json`: The best analysis approach
- `SampleCode_generate_result.json`: The fix generation result
- `SampleCode_generate_best_approach.json`: The best fix approach
- `SampleCode_apply_result.json`: The fix application result
- `SampleCode_apply_best_approach.json`: The best application approach

## Using the Tree-of-Thought API

### Analyzing Code

```csharp
var treeOfThoughtService = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<SimpleTreeOfThoughtService>();
var analysisResult = await treeOfThoughtService.AnalyzeCodeAsync(code);
```

### Generating Fixes

```csharp
var fixGenerationResult = await treeOfThoughtService.GenerateFixesAsync(issue);
```

### Applying Fixes

```csharp
var fixApplicationResult = await treeOfThoughtService.ApplyFixAsync(fix);
```

### Selecting the Best Approach

```csharp
var bestApproach = await treeOfThoughtService.SelectBestApproachAsync(thoughtTreeJson);
```

## Extending the Implementation

### Adding New Analysis Approaches

To add new analysis approaches, modify the `Analysis.analyzeCode` function in the `SimpleTreeOfThought.fs` file.

### Adding New Fix Generation Approaches

To add new fix generation approaches, modify the `FixGeneration.generateFixes` function in the `SimpleTreeOfThought.fs` file.

### Adding New Fix Application Approaches

To add new fix application approaches, modify the `FixApplication.applyFix` function in the `SimpleTreeOfThought.fs` file.

## Next Steps

This is a simplified implementation of the Tree-of-Thought reasoning approach. To create a more robust implementation, consider:

1. **Implementing a Full Thought Tree**: Extend the thought tree to support more complex reasoning
2. **Adding More Evaluation Metrics**: Implement more sophisticated evaluation metrics
3. **Integrating with Metascripts**: Integrate the Tree-of-Thought reasoning with the metascript system
4. **Implementing a Complete Pipeline**: Create a complete auto-improvement pipeline using Tree-of-Thought reasoning
