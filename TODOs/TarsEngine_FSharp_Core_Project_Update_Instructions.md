# Instructions to Update TarsEngine.FSharp.Core.fsproj

I've created a new project file that includes all the Intelligence module files. Please follow these steps to update your project file:

1. Make sure you have a backup of your current project file:
   ```
   Copy-Item "TarsEngine.FSharp.Core/TarsEngine.FSharp.Core.fsproj" "TarsEngine.FSharp.Core/TarsEngine.FSharp.Core.fsproj.bak"
   ```

2. Replace your current project file with the new one:
   ```
   Copy-Item "TarsEngine.FSharp.Core.fsproj.new" "TarsEngine.FSharp.Core/TarsEngine.FSharp.Core.fsproj"
   ```

3. Reload the project in Visual Studio or your IDE.

4. Build the project to ensure all files are properly included.
