# TARS Engine F# Metascript Module Migration

## Overview
This document outlines the plan and progress for migrating the Metascript module from C# to F# as part of the ongoing TARS Engine migration effort.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Core Types and Interfaces
- [x] Create MetascriptExecutionResult.fs
- [x] Create IMetascriptService.fs
- [x] Create IMetascriptExecutor.fs

### 2. Service Implementations
- [x] Implement MetascriptService.fs
- [x] Implement MetascriptExecutor.fs

### 3. Dependency Injection
- [x] Implement ServiceCollectionExtensions.fs

### 4. Project File Updates
- [x] Update TarsEngine.FSharp.Core.fsproj to include the new Metascript files

## Next Steps
1. Implement DSL parsing and execution components
2. Enhance the MetascriptService to support F# code blocks
3. Create unit tests for the Metascript module

## Migration Status
- Core Types and Interfaces: Complete
- Service Implementations: Complete (basic functionality)
- Dependency Injection: Complete
- Project File Updates: Complete
- DSL Parsing and Execution: Not Started
- Unit Tests: Not Started

## Notes
- The current implementation is a basic placeholder that mimics the C# implementation
- Further enhancements are needed to support F# code blocks and other DSL elements
- Integration with the rest of the system needs to be verified
