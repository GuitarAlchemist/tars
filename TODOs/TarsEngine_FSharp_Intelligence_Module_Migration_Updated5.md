# TARS Engine F# Intelligence Module Migration

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for migrating the Intelligence module from C# to F# as part of the ongoing TARS Engine migration effort.

## Project File Updates
The following files need to be added to the TarsEngine.FSharp.Core.fsproj file. Instructions have been provided in `TODOs/TarsEngine_FSharp_Core_Project_Update.md`.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Core Types and Interfaces
- [x] Create Types.fs with all necessary types and enums
- [x] Create interface files for each component

### 2. CreativeThinking Implementation
- [x] Implement CreativeThinkingBase.fs
- [x] Implement CreativeIdeaGeneration.fs
- [x] Implement CreativeSolutionGeneration.fs
- [x] Implement CreativeThinking.fs (main implementation)

### 3. IntuitiveReasoning Implementation
- [x] Implement IntuitiveReasoningBase.fs
- [x] Implement IntuitionGeneration.fs
- [x] Implement IntuitiveDecisionMaking.fs
- [x] Implement IntuitiveReasoning.fs (main implementation)

### 4. SpontaneousThought Implementation
- [x] Implement SpontaneousThoughtBase.fs
- [x] Implement ThoughtGeneration.fs
- [x] Implement SpontaneousThought.fs (main implementation)

### 5. CuriosityDrive Implementation
- [x] Implement CuriosityDriveBase.fs
- [x] Implement QuestionGeneration.fs
- [x] Implement ExplorationMethods.fs
- [x] Implement CuriosityDrive.fs (main implementation)

### 6. InsightGeneration Implementation
- [x] Implement InsightGenerationBase.fs
- [ ] Implement ConnectionDiscovery.fs (partially implemented)
- [ ] Implement ProblemRestructuring.fs
- [ ] Implement InsightGeneration.fs (main implementation)

### 7. IntelligenceSpark Implementation
- [ ] Implement IntelligenceSparkBase.fs
- [ ] Implement IntelligenceCoordination.fs
- [ ] Implement IntelligenceReporting.fs
- [ ] Implement IntelligenceSpark.fs (main implementation)

### 8. Dependency Injection
- [x] Implement ServiceCollectionExtensions.fs (partial implementation - needs to be updated as more components are completed)

## Testing Plan
- [ ] Create unit tests for each component
- [ ] Create integration tests for the Intelligence module
- [ ] Verify functionality matches the C# implementation

## Migration Status
- Core Types and Interfaces: Complete
- CreativeThinking Implementation: Complete
- IntuitiveReasoning Implementation: Complete
- SpontaneousThought Implementation: Complete
- CuriosityDrive Implementation: Complete
- InsightGeneration Implementation: In Progress (1/4 files complete)
- IntelligenceSpark Implementation: Not Started
- Dependency Injection: Partial (needs to be updated as more components are completed)
- Testing: Not Started
- Project File Updates: Instructions provided, needs to be manually updated

## Next Steps
1. Complete the InsightGeneration implementation
2. Implement the IntelligenceSpark component
3. Update the dependency injection to include all components
4. Update the project file to include all new files
5. Create unit tests for the implemented components
