# TARS Engine F# Migration TODOs

## Overview
This directory contains task tracking documents for the TARS Engine migration from C# to F#. The migration is organized into a hierarchical structure of tasks, from high-level stages to extremely granular implementation steps.

## Document Structure

### Main Migration Document
- **TarsEngine_FSharp_Migration_Updated.md**: The main document that provides an overview of all migration stages and high-level tasks. This document links to more detailed module-specific task files.

### Module-Specific Task Documents
These documents provide detailed, granular tasks for each module:

- **TarsEngine_FSharp_Migration_Decision_Module.md**: Tasks for the Decision module
- **TarsEngine_FSharp_Migration_Reasoning_Module.md**: Tasks for the Reasoning module
- **TarsEngine_FSharp_Migration_Planning_Module.md**: Tasks for the Planning module
- **TarsEngine_FSharp_Migration_Divergent_Module.md**: Tasks for the Divergent module
- **TarsEngine_FSharp_Migration_Exploration_Module.md**: Tasks for the Exploration module
- **TarsEngine_FSharp_Migration_Learning_Module.md**: Tasks for the Learning module
- **TarsEngine_FSharp_Migration_Creativity_Module.md**: Tasks for the Creativity module
- **TarsEngine_FSharp_Migration_ProblemSolving_Module.md**: Tasks for the Problem Solving module
- **TarsEngine_FSharp_Migration_Knowledge_Module.md**: Tasks for the Knowledge module
- **TarsEngine_FSharp_Migration_Adaptation_Module.md**: Tasks for the Adaptation module
- **TarsEngine_FSharp_Migration_Metacognition_Module.md**: Tasks for the Metacognition module
- **TarsEngine_FSharp_Migration_ML_Module.md**: Tasks for the Machine Learning module
- **TarsEngine_FSharp_Migration_Metascript_Module.md**: Tasks for the Metascript and DSL module
- **TarsEngine_FSharp_Migration_CLI_Module.md**: Tasks for the CLI and Integration module
- **TarsEngine_FSharp_Migration_Testing.md**: Tasks for Testing and Validation
- **TarsEngine_FSharp_Migration_Cleanup.md**: Tasks for Cleanup and Finalization

### Implementation-Level Task Documents
For some modules, we have even more granular task breakdowns:

- **TarsEngine_FSharp_Migration_Decision_Module_Granular.md**: Ultra-granular tasks for the Decision module
- **TarsEngine_FSharp_Migration_Decision_Module_Implementation.md**: Implementation-level tasks with code snippets for the Decision module

## Task Granularity Levels

1. **Stage Level**: The highest level of organization, representing major phases of the migration (e.g., Core Infrastructure, Consciousness Module).

2. **Module Level**: Tasks for migrating specific modules (e.g., Decision, Reasoning, Planning).

3. **File Level**: Tasks for creating and implementing specific files within a module (e.g., Types.fs, DecisionService.fs).

4. **Function Level**: Tasks for implementing specific functions or methods within a file.

5. **Implementation Level**: The most granular level, with specific implementation steps for each function or method, sometimes including code snippets.

## How to Use These Documents

1. Start with the main **TarsEngine_FSharp_Migration_Updated.md** document to get an overview of the migration progress.

2. For modules you're working on, refer to the module-specific task document for detailed tasks.

3. For modules with ultra-granular task breakdowns, refer to the corresponding granular task document.

4. Mark tasks as completed by updating the appropriate document(s).

5. Add progress notes at the bottom of the documents to track significant milestones.

## Progress Tracking

Progress is tracked using checkboxes:
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task

Additionally, each stage and module has a status indicator:
- ✅ Completed
- 🔄 In Progress
- ⬜ Not Started

## Contributing

When working on the migration:

1. Choose a module or task to work on.
2. Update the corresponding task document(s) as you make progress.
3. Add detailed implementation notes if necessary.
4. Update the main migration document to reflect overall progress.
