## Actual Completion Assessment

Based on our verification, the Intelligence Measurement System is approximately **85%** complete, not 98% as reported. The main missing components are:

1. HTML report generation implementation
2. CLI commands for intelligence measurement
3. Unit and integration tests
4. Documentation

These components are essential for a fully functional system and should be implemented before considering the system complete.
