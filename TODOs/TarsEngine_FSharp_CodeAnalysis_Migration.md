# TARS Engine F# Code Analysis Module Migration

## Overview
This document outlines the plan and progress for migrating the Code Analysis module from C# to F# as part of the ongoing TARS Engine migration effort.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Core Types
- [x] Define ProgrammingLanguage type
- [x] Define IssueSeverity type
- [x] Define MetricType type
- [x] Define MetricScope type
- [x] Define MetricQuality type
- [x] Define StructureType type
- [x] Define CodeLocation type
- [x] Define CodeStructure type
- [x] Define CodeIssue type
- [x] Define CodeMetric type
- [x] Define ComplexityMetrics type
- [x] Define CodePattern type
- [x] Define Pattern type
- [x] Define Match type
- [x] Define Transformation type
- [x] Define Report type
- [x] Define Configuration type
- [x] Define CodeAnalysisResult type

### 2. Services
- [x] Define ICodeAnalysisService interface
- [x] Implement CodeAnalysisService class
- [ ] Implement language-specific analyzers
  - [ ] CSharpAnalyzer
  - [ ] FSharpAnalyzer
  - [ ] JavaScriptAnalyzer
  - [ ] PythonAnalyzer

### 3. Dependency Injection
- [x] Create ServiceCollectionExtensions for registering code analysis services

### 4. Project File Updates
- [x] Add new Code Analysis files to the project file
- [x] Ensure correct file ordering for F# compilation

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Create unit tests for Code Analysis module
- [ ] Test integration with other modules

## Migration Status
- Core Types: Complete
- Services: Partially Complete
- Dependency Injection: Complete
- Project File Updates: Complete
- Testing: Not Started

## Next Steps
1. Implement language-specific analyzers
2. Create unit tests for the Code Analysis module
3. Test integration with other modules
4. Implement additional Code Analysis features as needed

## Notes
- The Code Analysis module has been partially migrated from C# to F#
- The implementation maintains compatibility with the existing F# types
- The CodeAnalysisService implements the ICodeAnalysisService interface
- Additional language-specific analyzers need to be implemented
- Unit tests need to be created to ensure the module works as expected
