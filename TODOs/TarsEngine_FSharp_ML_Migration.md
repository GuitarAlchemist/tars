# TARS Engine F# ML Module Migration

## Overview
This document outlines the plan and progress for migrating the ML module from C# to F# as part of the ongoing TARS Engine migration effort.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Core Types
- [x] Create MLFrameworkOptions type
- [x] Update ModelMetadata type
- [x] Create MLException type

### 2. MLFramework Implementation
- [x] Create MLFramework class
- [x] Implement Model Loading
- [x] Implement Model Training
- [x] Implement Prediction
- [x] Implement Model Management
- [x] Implement Metadata Management

### 3. MLService Implementation
- [x] Create MLService class
- [x] Implement Service Methods

### 4. Dependency Injection
- [x] Create ServiceCollectionExtensions

### 5. Project File Updates
- [x] Add new ML files to the project file
- [x] Ensure correct file ordering for F# compilation

### 6. Testing
- [ ] Create Unit Tests
- [ ] Test Integration with other modules

## Migration Status
- Core Types: Complete
- MLFramework Implementation: Complete
- MLService Implementation: Complete
- Dependency Injection: Complete
- Project File Updates: Complete
- Testing: Not Started

## Next Steps
1. Create unit tests for the ML module
2. Test integration with other modules
3. Implement additional ML features as needed

## Notes
- The ML module has been successfully migrated from C# to F#
- The implementation maintains compatibility with the existing F# types
- The MLService implements the IMLService interface
- The MLFramework provides the core functionality for machine learning
- Additional ML features can be added as needed
