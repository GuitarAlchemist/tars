# TARS Engine F# Intelligence Module Migration

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for migrating the Intelligence module from C# to F# as part of the ongoing TARS Engine migration effort.

## Project File Updates
The following files need to be added to the TarsEngine.FSharp.Core.fsproj file:

```xml
<!-- Intelligence -->
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Types.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/ICreativeThinking.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/IIntuitiveReasoning.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/ISpontaneousThought.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/ICuriosityDrive.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/IInsightGeneration.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/IIntelligenceSpark.fs" />

<!-- CreativeThinking Implementation -->
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/CreativeThinking/CreativeThinkingBase.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/CreativeThinking/CreativeIdeaGeneration.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/CreativeThinking/CreativeSolutionGeneration.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/CreativeThinking/CreativeThinking.fs" />

<!-- IntuitiveReasoning Implementation -->
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/IntuitiveReasoning/IntuitiveReasoningBase.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/IntuitiveReasoning/IntuitionGeneration.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/IntuitiveReasoning/IntuitiveDecisionMaking.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/IntuitiveReasoning/IntuitiveReasoning.fs" />
```

As implementation progresses, the following files will also need to be added:

```xml
<!-- SpontaneousThought Implementation -->
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/SpontaneousThought/SpontaneousThoughtBase.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/SpontaneousThought/ThoughtGeneration.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/SpontaneousThought/SpontaneousThought.fs" />

<!-- CuriosityDrive Implementation -->
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/CuriosityDrive/CuriosityDriveBase.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/CuriosityDrive/QuestionGeneration.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/CuriosityDrive/ExplorationMethods.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/CuriosityDrive/CuriosityDrive.fs" />

<!-- InsightGeneration Implementation -->
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/InsightGeneration/InsightGenerationBase.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/InsightGeneration/ConnectionDiscovery.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/InsightGeneration/ProblemRestructuring.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/InsightGeneration/InsightGeneration.fs" />

<!-- IntelligenceSpark Implementation -->
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/IntelligenceSpark/IntelligenceSparkBase.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/IntelligenceSpark/IntelligenceCoordination.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/IntelligenceSpark/IntelligenceReporting.fs" />
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/Services/IntelligenceSpark/IntelligenceSpark.fs" />

<!-- Dependency Injection -->
<Compile Include="Consciousness/Intelligence/DependencyInjection/ServiceCollectionExtensions.fs" />
```
