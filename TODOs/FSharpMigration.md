# F# Migration TODOs

## Phase 1: Fix Existing F# Code and Establish Foundation

### Fix Existing F# Compilation Errors
- [ ] Resolve type mismatches in `TarsEngine.TreeOfThought`
- [ ] Fix issues in `MetascriptGeneration.fs` and `MetascriptToT.fs`
- [ ] Address namespace collisions between F# and C# code
- [ ] Fix `ThoughtNode` vs `MetascriptThoughtNode` type conflicts

### Create Clean F# Core Library
- [ ] Create `TarsEngine.FSharp.Core` project
- [ ] Define core types and interfaces
- [ ] Implement basic utility functions
- [ ] Set up proper namespace structure to avoid collisions

### Establish Interoperability Layer
- [ ] Create adapter patterns for C#/F# communication
- [ ] Define clear boundaries between languages
- [ ] Implement conversion functions between C# and F# types

## Phase 2: Migrate Core Algorithm Components

### Tree-of-Thought Implementation
- [ ] Migrate `TarsEngine.Services.TreeOfThought` to F#
- [ ] Implement proper type hierarchies
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Create visualization tools for thought trees

### Code Analysis Services
- [ ] Migrate pattern detection to F#
- [ ] Implement functional approach to code transformation
- [ ] Create F# wrappers for Roslyn API
- [ ] Implement semantic analysis in F#

### Metascript Engine
- [ ] Reimplement metascript execution in F#
- [ ] Create functional DSL for metascripts
- [ ] Implement metascript generation using F#
- [ ] Add support for F# code generation in metascripts

## Phase 3: Migrate Domain Services

### Knowledge Repository
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate implementations
- [ ] Migrate to F# with immutable data structures
- [ ] Implement functional approach to knowledge management
- [ ] Create adapters for existing C# consumers

### AI Services
- [ ] Migrate model interaction to F#
- [ ] Implement functional approach to prompt engineering
- [ ] Create F# types for AI responses
- [ ] Implement functional composition for AI pipelines

### Compilation Services
- [ ] Migrate code generation to F#
- [ ] Implement functional approach to AST manipulation
- [ ] Create F# wrappers for compilation APIs
- [ ] Implement F# script execution engine

## Phase 4: Integration and Optimization

### CLI Integration
- [ ] Update CLI to use F# implementations
- [ ] Maintain C# for user interface components
- [ ] Create F# command handlers
- [ ] Implement F# option parsing

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize F# code for performance
- [ ] Implement parallel processing where appropriate
- [ ] Add caching for expensive operations
- [ ] Profile and optimize critical paths

### Documentation and Examples
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Provide examples of F# usage
- [ ] Document interoperability patterns
- [ ] Create migration guides for future components
