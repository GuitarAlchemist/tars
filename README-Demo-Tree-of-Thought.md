# Demo Tree-of-Thought Auto-Improvement

This document provides instructions on how to use the Demo Tree-of-Thought auto-improvement pipeline.

## Overview

The Demo Tree-of-Thought auto-improvement pipeline demonstrates the concept of using Tree-of-Thought reasoning to analyze code, generate improvements, and apply those improvements. This is a simplified implementation that shows the potential of the approach.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 6.0 or later

## Getting Started

### 1. Build the Project

```bash
dotnet build
```

### 2. Run the Demo Auto-Improvement Pipeline

```bash
./run_demo_auto_improvement.ps1
```

This script will:
1. Create the necessary directories
2. Run the demo auto-improvement pipeline command

### 3. Examine the Results

The results will be saved in the following file:
- `demo_auto_improvement_report.md`: Report of the demo auto-improvement pipeline

## Using the CLI Command

```bash
dotnet run --project TarsCli demo-auto-improve --file <file> --type <improvement-type> --output <output-file>
```

### Options

- `--file`, `-f`: The file to improve (required)
- `--type`, `-t`: The type of improvement to make (default: "performance")
- `--output`, `-o`: The output file for the report (default: "demo_auto_improvement_report.md")

## How It Works

The Demo Tree-of-Thought auto-improvement pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. **Analysis**: Analyze the code using Tree-of-Thought reasoning
   - Static Analysis (Score: 0.8)
   - Pattern Matching (Score: 0.7)
   - Semantic Analysis (Score: 0.9)

2. **Improvement Generation**: Generate improvements using Tree-of-Thought reasoning
   - Direct Fix (Score: 0.7)
   - Refactoring (Score: 0.9)
   - Alternative Implementation (Score: 0.6)

3. **Improvement Application**: Apply the improvements using Tree-of-Thought reasoning
   - In-Place Modification (Score: 0.8)
   - Staged Application (Score: 0.7)
   - Transactional Application (Score: 0.9)

For each step, the Tree-of-Thought reasoning explores multiple approaches, evaluates them, and selects the best one based on a score.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement F# Integration**: Create a proper F# project for the Tree-of-Thought implementation
2. **Enhance the Reasoning**: Improve the Tree-of-Thought reasoning for better results
3. **Integrate with TARS**: Integrate with the TARS auto-improvement pipeline
4. **Add More Improvement Types**: Add support for more improvement types
5. **Implement Real Code Transformation**: Implement actual code transformation instead of simulation
