== Requirements

The following system and product requirements define the initial scope and expectations for the TARS framework.

=== Must Have
- [M] Support for defining modular agents with distinct roles (e.g. Planner, Coder, Critic, Executor).
- [M] F#-based DSL for composing workflows using computation expressions (monadic style).
- [M] Integration with OpenAI or Azure-hosted LLMs to run prompt-based reasoning.
- [M] Execution engine that can evaluate and trace multi-step plans involving nested prompts and tasks.
- [M] Interoperability with C#/.NET components for extensibility and infrastructure integration.
- [M] Logging and traceability of reasoning steps, including prompt/response history and error handling.
- [M] Minimal front-end (CLI or web-based) to inspect and test agent workflows.

=== Should Have
- [S] Support for agent communication models (e.g., AutoGen-like back-and-forth).
- [S] Configurable memory module to persist context and intermediate outputs.
- [S] Embeddable DSLs for task types (e.g. planning, coding, parsing).
- [S] Extensible plugin system to support new agent types or backends (e.g., Wolfram, ReAct).
- [S] Visual or structured output format for workflow introspection (e.g. JSON trace or PlantUML graph).

=== Could Have
- [C] Self-improving inner loop for agents to revise own code, prompts, or workflows.
- [C] GUI-based builder or REPL for experimenting with agent workflows interactively.
- [C] Test suite auto-generation based on agent plans and outputs.
- [C] Support for remote execution or distributed agents.

=== Wonâ€™t Have (for MVP)
- [W] Built-in deployment of production applications.
- [W] Real-time collaboration between human and agent users.
- [W] General-purpose web app interface for non-technical users.
