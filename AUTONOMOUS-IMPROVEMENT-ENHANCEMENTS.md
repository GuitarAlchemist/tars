# Autonomous Improvement Metascript Enhancements

This document describes the enhancements made to the autonomous improvement metascript in the TARS project.

## Overview

The autonomous improvement metascript has been enhanced with several new features to improve its effectiveness, intelligence, and reliability. These enhancements focus on better knowledge extraction, smarter prioritization, intelligence metrics tracking, and state persistence.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Knowledge Extraction

- **Exploration Value Analysis**: Added functionality to analyze and score exploration files based on their value and relevance to the project.
- **Complex Knowledge Parsing**: Improved parsing of complex knowledge structures from exploration files.
- **High-Value Content Identification**: Added intelligence to identify and prioritize high-value content in exploration files.
- **Adaptive Extraction Depth**: Extraction depth now varies based on the assessed value of the content.

### 2. Improved Prioritization Algorithm

- **Strategic Goal Alignment**: Files are now prioritized based on their alignment with strategic project goals.
- **Core Component Focus**: Added weighting to prioritize core components that would benefit most from improvements.
- **Dependency Analysis**: The algorithm now considers file dependencies when prioritizing files for improvement.
- **Code Complexity Analysis**: Files with higher complexity are given higher priority for improvement.

### 3. Intelligence Progression Measurement

- **Quality Metrics**: Added metrics to track knowledge quality and improvement quality over time.
- **Code Quality Benchmarking**: Implemented before/after benchmarking of code quality for improved files.
- **Learning Rate Tracking**: Added tracking of the system's learning rate over multiple runs.
- **Visualization**: Added visualization of intelligence progression in reports.

### 4. State Management on Disk

- **YAML State Persistence**: The metascript now manages its own state on disk using YAML files.
- **Run History**: Added tracking of run history for long-term analysis and improvement.
- **Periodic State Saving**: Implemented periodic state saving to prevent data loss during execution.
- **Recovery Capability**: The metascript can now recover from interruptions by loading its previous state.

## Usage

The enhanced autonomous improvement metascript can be run using the following command:

```bash
./run-autonomous-improvement.cmd
```

Or directly through the TARS CLI:

```bash
dotnet run --project TarsCli/TarsCli.csproj -- autonomous run
```

## Configuration

The metascript can be configured by modifying the strategic goals and target directories in the metascript file:

```
// Define strategic goals for prioritization
VARIABLE strategic_goals {
    value: [
        {
            "name": "DSL Enhancement",
            "keywords": ["DSL", "metascript", "interpreter", "parser", "evaluator"],
            "weight": 1.5
        },
        // Additional strategic goals...
    ]
}
```

## Reports

The metascript generates two types of reports:

1. **Autonomous Improvement Report**: A summary of the improvement process, including files processed, improvements made, and next steps.
2. **Intelligence Metrics Report**: Detailed metrics on knowledge quality, improvement quality, and intelligence progression over time.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:

- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for continuous autonomous improvement
- More sophisticated code quality analysis
- Machine learning-based prioritization
- Collaborative improvement with human feedback
