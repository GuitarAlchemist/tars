TARS REASONING: Parameters are physically reasonable. H0=72.0 is within observational bounds, αJ=1.15 suggests moderate modification, Ω_total=1.000 is close to flat universe.

TARS MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS:

1. Parameter Consistency Check:
   Parameters suggest flat universe geometry (consistent with observations)
   H₀ = 72.0 km/s/Mpc (observational range: 67-74)
   Ωₘ = 0.310, ΩΛ = 0.690, Ω_total = 1.000
   αⱼ = 1.150 (Janus parameter indicates moderate modification (plausible range))

2. Formula Verification Results:
   Average confidence: 89.5%
   High confidence in mathematical formulation

3. Observational Consistency:
   Average match score: 3.4%
   Significant tension with observations

4. Statistical Analysis:
   χ² = 3.747
   Reduced χ² = Infinity
   p-value = 0.1536
   Model shows tension with observational data

5. TARS Reasoning Summary:
   TARS identifies areas requiring further investigation and refinement
