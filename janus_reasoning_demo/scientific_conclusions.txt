JANUS MODEL SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS

1. TARS CONCLUSION: Limited evidence for Janus model with αⱼ = 1.150 (3.4% observational consistency)
2. TARS REASONING: Janus parameter suggests minimal modification to general relativity
3. TARS ANALYSIS: H₀ = 72.0 km/s/Mpc provides intermediate value (potential compromise)
4. TARS CONCLUSION: Model requires further refinement to match observational constraints

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 3.4%
