# TARS Project

## MCP and A2A Integration for Agent Collaboration

TARS now features powerful integrations through both the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol:

### MCP Integration

TARS integrates with VSCode Agent Mode and Augment Code through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This integration enables a seamless collaboration between these three systems, leveraging their respective strengths:

- **TARS**: Provides domain-specific capabilities like metascript processing, DSL handling, and self-improvement
- **VSCode Agent Mode**: Provides the user interface and autonomous agent capabilities within the editor
- **Augment Code**: Offers deep codebase understanding and specialized code generation

The integration is built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which enables AI models to interact with external tools and services through a unified interface.

To get started with the MCP integration, see [VS Code Integration](docs/vscode-integration.md) and [Augment VS Code Integration](docs/features/augment-vscode-integration.md).

### A2A Protocol Support

TARS now supports the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, an open standard developed by Google to enable interoperability between AI agents. This allows TARS to communicate with other A2A-compatible agents and expose its capabilities through a standardized interface.

Key features of the A2A implementation include:

- **Agent Discovery**: Expose TARS capabilities through agent cards
- **Task Submission**: Send and receive tasks between agents
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time updates during task execution
- **Push Notifications**: Notify agents of task status changes
- **MCP Bridge**: Seamless integration between A2A and MCP

To get started with the A2A protocol, see [A2A Protocol Documentation](docs/A2A-Protocol.md).

We've recently fixed several build errors in the TARS solution related to model class compatibility, service conflicts, and nullability warnings. These fixes include:

- Resolved ambiguous references to IssueSeverity enum
- Fixed property mismatches in CodeIssue, CodeStructure, and other model classes
- Updated enum values in CodeIssueType and MetricType to match the codebase
- Fixed conflicts between TestRunnerService classes in different namespaces
- Resolved nullability warnings in the LoggerAdapter class
